# Story 2.1b: Implement Delta Feed Parser & Order Book Engine

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** quantitative researcher,
**I want** the pipeline to reconstruct the full order book state from book_delta_v2 updates,
**so that** I can achieve maximum fidelity backtesting that perfectly mirrors live trading conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The order book engine maintains accurate L2 book state (top 20 levels) from delta updates
2. Delta updates are processed in strict update_id order with monotonic sequence validation
3. Sequence gaps are detected and logged with recovery mechanisms in place
4. The engine implements the Hybrid Delta-Event Sourcing Architecture for 40-65% memory efficiency
5. Hot path operations use scaled int64 arithmetic instead of Decimal128 for performance
6. Memory-mapped processing is implemented for 13x I/O improvement
7. Manual garbage collection control reduces pause times by 20-40%
8. Performance benchmarks validate all optimizations against baseline (336K messages/second)
9. State checkpointing enables crash recovery without data loss

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- From Story 2.1: Data ingestion and unification implemented with BookDeltaV2Reader
- BookDeltaV2Reader successfully reads delta data but does NOT reconstruct book state
- Decimal precision handled with decimal_utils module (workaround for Polars limitations)
- Performance baseline: ~336K messages/second for golden sample processing
- Memory usage validated at 1.67GB for 8M events (14x safety margin)

### Data Models
**Book Delta v2 Data** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lines-64-93]
- Required: `origin_time` (int64 nanoseconds), `update_id` (monotonic), `price`, `new_quantity`, `side`
- **0% sequence gaps** validated across 11.15M messages in Epic 1
- `new_quantity` of 0 indicates price level removal
- Multiple deltas can have same `origin_time` but different `update_id`
- Processing must be in strict update_id order

**Order Book State Structure** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-78-105]
```python
class StreamingOrderBook:
    def __init__(self, max_levels: int = 20):
        self.bids = BoundedPriceLevel(max_levels)
        self.asks = BoundedPriceLevel(max_levels)
        self.last_update_id = 0
        self.gap_counter = GapStatistics()
```

### API Specifications
**Stateful Replay Algorithm** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-130-160]
- Initialize book from first snapshot encountered
- Apply deltas in update_id order with gap detection
- Track drift metrics between snapshots
- Implement resynchronization logic for accumulated drift
- Enrich events with current book state

### Component Specifications
**Order Book Engine Features** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-161-178]
- Stateful Order Book Engine with bounded memory (top 20 levels)
- Drift tracking to quantify information loss
- Liquidity consumption modeling for trades
- Sequence gap detection with update_id continuity monitoring
- Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for crash recovery
- Streaming mode for memory constraint handling
- Monotonic ordering enforcement

- Tests: `tests/reconstruction/test_order_book_engine.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/reconstruction/test_order_book_integration.py`

### Testing Requirements
- Sustained throughput: Must maintain 336K+ messages/second
- Memory bounded: Never exceed 1GB for processing
- Sequence integrity: 0% gaps tolerance (matching golden samples)
- Checkpoint recovery: Pipeline must resume correctly after crash

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Optimizations** [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]
- [R-CLD-01] Hybrid Delta-Event Sourcing: 40-65% memory reduction
- [R-GMN-01] Scaled int64 arithmetic: Use int64 pips (price * 10^8) in hot path
- [R-CLD-02] Memory-mapped processing: 13x I/O improvement
- [R-CLD-04] Manual GC control: 20-40% pause time reduction
- [R-GMN-04] Hybrid data structure: Arrays for top levels, hash for deep book

**Memory Management** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md#lines-14-21]
- Never load more than 1GB of raw data at once
- Implement backpressure signaling between stages
- Queue sizes: Read(1k), Parse(2k), Process(2k), Write(5k)
- Regular checkpoint every 1M events or 5 minutes

**Decimal Precision** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lines-16-19]
- Internal calculations use int64 "pips" for performance
- Store prices as int64 with implicit 8 decimal places
- Convert to decimal128 only for final output
- Maintain precision throughout processing

### Implementation Patterns
**ChronologicalEventReplay Pattern** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-109-160]
1. Data ingestion with type labeling (already done in Story 2.1)
2. Unification and stable sort by origin_time (already done in Story 2.1)
3. Schema normalization to unified format
4. **Stateful replay with order book maintenance** (THIS STORY)

**Streaming Pipeline Pattern** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md#lines-24-28]
```
[Disk Reader] → [Parser] → [Order Book Engine] → [Event Formatter] → [Parquet Writer]
      ↓            ↓              ↓                    ↓                  ↓
   Queue(1k)    Queue(2k)     Queue(2k)           Queue(5k)         Checkpoint
```

**Zero-Copy Operations** [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md#lines-30-46]
- Use Arrow arrays throughout pipeline
- Avoid DataFrame copies
- Process in-place where possible

### Project Structure Notes
- All order book components go under `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/`
- Follow existing patterns from data_ingestion.py and unification.py
- Use dependency injection for configuration
- Maintain separation between state management and processing logic

### Specific Testing Requirements
1. **Sequence Gap Tests**: Inject artificial gaps, verify detection and recovery
