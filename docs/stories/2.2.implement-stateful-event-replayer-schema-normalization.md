# Story 2.2: Implement Stateful Event Replayer & Schema Normalization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** quantitative researcher,
**I want** the pipeline to replay chronological events while maintaining accurate market state,
**so that** I can have a unified event stream with proper order book state for each event

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The ChronologicalEventReplay algorithm processes events in strict origin_time order
2. Events with the same origin_time are sub-sorted by update_id to maintain causality
3. All events are transformed to the Unified Market Event Schema with proper nullable fields
4. Order book state is initialized from the first snapshot encountered
5. Trade events properly consume liquidity from the maintained book state
6. Periodic snapshots are used for drift measurement and resynchronization
7. Drift metrics are tracked and reported with RMS error threshold of 0.001 (0.1%) for resync triggering
8. The replayer handles all three event types: TRADE, BOOK_SNAPSHOT, and BOOK_DELTA
9. Memory usage remains bounded under 500MB with only top 20 bid/ask levels maintained

### Data Models
**Unified Market Event Schema** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lines-98-123]
```typescript
interface UnifiedMarketEvent {
  // Core identifiers
  event_timestamp: number;      // Nanosecond precision, from origin_time
  event_type: 'TRADE' | 'BOOK_SNAPSHOT' | 'BOOK_DELTA';
  update_id?: number;           // For maintaining event ordering
  
  // Trade-specific data (null if not TRADE)
  trade_id?: number;
  trade_price?: Decimal128;     // decimal128(38,18)
  trade_quantity?: Decimal128;  // decimal128(38,18)
  trade_side?: 'BUY' | 'SELL';
  
  // Book snapshot data (null if not BOOK_SNAPSHOT)
  bids?: Array<[Decimal128, Decimal128]>;
  asks?: Array<[Decimal128, Decimal128]>;
  is_snapshot?: boolean;
  
  // Book delta data (null if not BOOK_DELTA)
  delta_side?: 'BID' | 'ASK';
  delta_price?: Decimal128;
  delta_quantity?: Decimal128;
}
```

**Event Processing Order** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-120-122]
- Events must be sorted by origin_time first
- Sub-sort by update_id for same timestamp events
- Use stable sort to preserve ordering

### API Specifications
**ChronologicalEventReplay Algorithm** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-109-160]
1. Data ingestion with type labeling (completed in Story 2.1)
2. Unification and stable sort by origin_time (completed in Story 2.1)
3. Schema normalization to unified format (THIS STORY)
4. Stateful replay with order book maintenance (THIS STORY)

**Stateful Replay Process** [Source: architecture/components.md#lines-130-160]
```python
def stateful_replay(self, events: pl.DataFrame) -> pl.DataFrame:
    order_book = OrderBookState()
    output_events = []
    drift_metrics = []
    
    for event in events.iter_rows(named=True):
        if event['event_type'] == 'BOOK_SNAPSHOT':
            if not order_book.initialized:
                order_book.initialize_from_snapshot(event)
            else:
                drift = order_book.calculate_drift(event)
                drift_metrics.append(drift)
                order_book.resynchronize(event)
        elif event['event_type'] == 'TRADE':
            order_book.apply_trade(event)
        elif event['event_type'] == 'BOOK_DELTA':
            order_book.apply_delta(event)
        
        event['book_state'] = order_book.get_current_state()
        output_events.append(event)
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- Unit tests for each component using Pytest
- Integration tests with golden sample data from `tests/fixtures/`
- Performance tests must validate 336K+ messages/second
- Memory tests must verify bounded usage under 500MB
- All tests run via GitHub Actions CI on every push

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]
- Must maintain 336K+ messages/second throughput
- Memory usage must stay under 500MB for processing
- Use zero-copy operations where possible
- Process events in micro-batches of 100-1000 [R-ALL-01]

**Streaming Architecture** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md#lines-24-28]
- Integrate with queue-based pipeline stages
- Maintain backpressure signaling
- Queue sizes: Process(2k) between stages
- Regular checkpointing for recovery

**Data Precision** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lines-10-20]
- Store all prices/quantities as decimal128(38,18)
- Use int64 pips as fallback if decimal performance fails
- Maintain precision throughout processing

### Implementation Patterns
**Pending Queue Pattern [R-OAI-01]** 
- Buffer updates during snapshot processing
- Apply atomically after snapshot is complete
- Prevents partial state updates

**Hybrid Data Structure [R-GMN-04]**
- Use contiguous arrays for top 20 levels
- Hash maps for deeper book levels
- Optimizes cache locality for hot data

**Drift Tracking Pattern**
- Calculate RMS error between reconstructed and snapshot books
- Track maximum deviation per price level
- Trigger resync when drift exceeds configurable threshold (default: RMS error > 0.001 or 0.1%)
- Log all drift events for analysis
- Example RMS calculation: sqrt(mean((snapshot_prices - reconstructed_prices)^2 / snapshot_prices^2))

### Project Structure Notes
- Event replayer integrates with existing UnifiedEventStreamEnhanced
- Reuses OrderBookEngine and OrderBookState from Story 2.1b
- Follows established patterns in reconstruction module
- Maintains separation between replay logic and state management
