# Story 2.5: Checkpointing & Recovery

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** data engineer,
**I want** the pipeline to implement copy-on-write checkpointing with non-blocking state persistence,
**so that** the system can recover from any failure and resume processing from the last checkpoint without data loss or performance degradation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The pipeline implements copy-on-write (COW) checkpointing for non-blocking state persistence
2. Checkpoints are created every 5 minutes or after processing 1M events (whichever comes first)
3. State snapshots complete in <100ms without blocking the main processing pipeline
4. Checkpoints include order book state, pipeline progress, and performance metrics
5. Recovery process can locate the latest valid checkpoint and resume processing from that point
6. Checkpoint data is stored using Parquet format with atomic write operations
7. System maintains only the last 3 checkpoints to manage disk usage
8. Checkpoint and recovery process is fully tested with crash simulations
9. Performance impact of checkpointing is <1% on overall throughput
10. Recovery validates data continuity between checkpoint and resume point

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.4 (Multi-Symbol Architecture):
- Pipeline now supports multiple symbols with process isolation
- Each symbol runs in its own process with 1GB memory limit
- ProcessManager handles worker lifecycle and crash recovery
- Queue-based architecture enables clean checkpoint integration points
- Symbol workers already have checkpoint_manager placeholder in implementation

### Existing CheckpointManager Implementation
The checkpoint_manager.py already exists with basic functionality:
- Currently supports pickle and JSON formats (needs Parquet support added)
- Has manual checkpoint triggers (needs time-based triggers added)
- Handles only order book state (needs full pipeline state support)
- Already implements atomic write pattern with temp files
- Has checkpoint cleanup to maintain max_checkpoints limit
- Provides load_latest_checkpoint() and load_checkpoint_by_update_id() methods

### Architecture Context

**Checkpoint Integration Points** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md lines 146-167]
```
[Disk Reader] → [Parser] → [Order Book Engine] → [Event Formatter] → [Parquet Writer]
                              ↓
                          Checkpoint
                          Manager
```

### Technical Specifications

**CheckpointManager Implementation** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md lines 146-167]
```python
class CheckpointManager:
    """Manage pipeline state for crash recovery."""
    
    def __init__(self, checkpoint_dir: Path):
        self.checkpoint_dir = checkpoint_dir
        self.checkpoint_interval = 300  # 5 minutes
        
    async def save_checkpoint(self, pipeline_state: Dict):
        """Atomic checkpoint write."""
        checkpoint_file = self.checkpoint_dir / f"checkpoint_{time.time()}.parquet"
        temp_file = checkpoint_file.with_suffix('.tmp')
        
        # Write state to Parquet (more efficient than pickle)
        pd.DataFrame([pipeline_state]).to_parquet(temp_file)
        
        # Atomic rename
        temp_file.rename(checkpoint_file)
        
        # Keep only last 3 checkpoints
        self.cleanup_old_checkpoints()
```

**State Components to Persist** [Source: architecture/components.md lines 166-171]
1. **Order Book State**:
   - Current bid/ask levels (top 20)
   - Last processed update_id
   - Last processed timestamp

2. **Pipeline Progress**:
   - Current file being processed
   - Offset within file  
   - Events processed count

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Gap statistics
   - Drift metrics
   - Processing rate counters

**Copy-on-Write Strategy** [Source: architecture/components.md lines 166-171]
- [ASSUMPTION][R-OAI-03] Copy-on-Write Checkpointing for non-blocking persistence
- Allows pipeline to continue processing during state persistence
- Critical for maintaining 100k+ events/second throughput
- Target <100ms pause for COW snapshot creation

**WAL Design** [Source: architecture/components.md lines 166-171]
- Simple append-only Parquet segments
- Atomic "DONE" markers for crash recovery
- Avoids RocksDB C++ dependency
- Integrates with checkpoint system for durability

### Performance Requirements

**Checkpoint Frequency** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md lines 73-75]
- Time-based: Every 5 minutes
- Event-based: Every 1M events processed
- On-demand: Before shutdown or when requested

**Performance Targets** [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]
- Checkpoint must not block main processing pipeline
- Use async I/O for checkpoint writes
- <100ms snapshot creation time
- <100MB checkpoint size for fast recovery
- <1% throughput impact

### Memory Management Strategy

**Double-Buffering Approach** [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md lines 73-96]
- Pre-allocate memory pools to avoid allocation during checkpointing
- Use separate memory regions for active processing and snapshots
- Implement double-buffering for zero-copy snapshots

### Recovery Process

**Recovery Steps** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md lines 146-167]
1. Locate latest valid checkpoint with "DONE" marker
2. Restore order book state from checkpoint
3. Restore pipeline progress (file offset, event count)
4. Seek to saved position in input files
5. Validate no gaps between checkpoint and resume point
6. Resume normal processing

### File Locations

**New Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md pattern]
- `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/checkpoint_manager.py` - Main checkpoint logic
- `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/wal_manager.py` - Write-ahead log support
- `tests/reconstruction/test_checkpoint_manager.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/reconstruction/test_checkpoint_recovery.py` - Integration tests

**Modified Files**:
- `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/order_book_engine.py` - Add checkpoint hooks
- `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/symbol_worker.py` - Integrate checkpoint triggers
- `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/pipeline_integration.py` - Add recovery logic


### Technical Constraints

**Storage Requirements**:
- Checkpoint size: ~50-100MB per symbol
- Keep only last 3 checkpoints
- Use Parquet for efficient columnar storage

**Compatibility**:
- Must work with existing multi-symbol architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility for single-symbol mode
- Support both streaming and batch processing modes

### Security Considerations

**Checkpoint File Security**:
- Set file permissions to 0600 (owner read/write only) on checkpoint files
- Store checkpoints in a secure directory with restricted access
- Implement integrity validation using checksums or HMAC
- Consider encryption for sensitive order book state data
- Validate checkpoint data on load to prevent tampering
- Use secure temp file creation (mkstemp) for atomic writes

## Testing

**Test Framework**: Pytest 8.2+ [Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]  
**Test Location**: `tests/reconstruction/` mirroring source structure  
**Coverage Target**: 80%+ for checkpoint/recovery code  

**Test Categories** [Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md lines 212-218]:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - CheckpointManager methods (save, load, cleanup)
   - COW state snapshot mechanisms
   - WAL operations and atomic writes
   - Parquet format support
   - Time-based trigger logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Full checkpoint/recovery cycle end-to-end
   - Multi-symbol checkpoint coordination
   - Pipeline resume validation with data continuity
   - Integration with existing order book engine
   - Checkpoint triggers during live processing

3. **Reliability Tests**:
   - Memory leak tests (24-hour continuous run)
   - Crash recovery (kill -9 scenarios)
   - Data consistency validation post-recovery
   - Concurrent checkpoint/processing stress tests
   - Disk full and I/O error handling

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Throughput impact measurement (<1% degradation required)
   - Snapshot timing validation (<100ms required)
   - Recovery speed benchmarks
   - Memory usage during COW operations
   - Checkpoint size growth over time

5. **Security Tests**:
   - File permission validation
   - Checkpoint integrity verification
   - Invalid/corrupted checkpoint handling

**Test Patterns**:
```python
def test_crash_recovery():
    # Start pipeline with checkpointing
    pipeline = create_pipeline(checkpoint_enabled=True)
    pipeline.process_events(test_data[:500000])
    
    # Simulate crash
    checkpoint_path = pipeline.checkpoint_manager.last_checkpoint
    pipeline.force_kill()
    
    # Recovery
    recovered_pipeline = create_pipeline(recover_from=checkpoint_path)
    recovered_pipeline.process_events(test_data[500000:])
    
    # Verify no data loss
    assert verify_output_continuity()

def test_checkpoint_security():
    # Create checkpoint
    checkpoint_path = checkpoint_manager.save_checkpoint(state, update_id)
    
    # Verify file permissions
    assert oct(checkpoint_path.stat().st_mode)[-3:] == "600"
    
    # Verify integrity on load
    loaded_state = checkpoint_manager.load_latest_checkpoint()
    assert verify_checksum(loaded_state)
```

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- Normal checkpoint during processing
- Recovery after clean shutdown
- Recovery after crash (SIGKILL)
- Multiple checkpoint cycles
- Checkpoint cleanup validation
- Time-based vs event-based triggers
- Corrupted checkpoint handling
- Disk space exhaustion
- Concurrent access protection
