# Story 1.2.5: Technical Validation Spike

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** data engineer,
**I want** to validate critical technical assumptions about delta feed viability and decimal handling,
**so that** we can make informed Go/No-Go decisions before committing to Epic 2 implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Delta feed analysis script exists that analyzes `book_delta_v2` data quality metrics (sequence gaps, completeness, update frequency)
2. Memory profiling demonstrates processing 1 hour of data (8M events) stays under 24GB P95 memory usage on target hardware
3. Throughput testing validates sustained performance of ≥100,000 events/second
4. Decimal128 pipeline PoC tests Polars decimal operations at scale, with int64 pips fallback implementation if needed
5. I/O analysis measures and validates disk throughput can sustain 150-200 MB/s for 20-hour processing
6. Performance baseline harness is created for ongoing regression monitoring
7. Comprehensive validation report documents all findings with clear Go/No-Go recommendations

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 completion]
- WebSocket capture utility framework established
- Poetry dependency management in place with Python 3.10+
- Loguru logging standards implemented
- Project follows modular architecture with `src/rlx_datapipe/` structure

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Input Schema 3: Raw Book Deltas]
- `book_delta_v2` schema includes:
  - `origin_time`: int64 (nanoseconds)
  - `update_id`: int64 (monotonic sequence)
  - `side`: string ('bid' or 'ask')
  - `price`: decimal128(38,18)
  - `new_quantity`: decimal128(38,18) - 0 means level removed
- Critical: `update_id` must be processed in monotonic order
- Sequence gaps indicate missed updates requiring recovery

### Decimal Strategy
[Source: architecture/decimal-strategy.md]
- Primary approach: Int64 pips conversion
  - BTC-USDT: 2 decimal places for price, 8 for quantity
  - Performance target: 5-10x faster than decimal types
- Fallback: PyArrow decimal128 if Polars fails
- Storage: All price/quantity fields as decimal128(38,18) in Parquet
- Must validate no precision loss in round-trip conversion

### Streaming Architecture
[Source: architecture/streaming-architecture.md]
- Memory constraints: Never exceed 28GB, operate within 24GB P95
- Pipeline stages: Disk Reader → Parser → Order Book Engine → Event Formatter → Parquet Writer
- Bounded queues between stages for backpressure handling
- Checkpoint recovery every 1M events or 5 minutes
- Memory monitoring with 85% warning, 95% critical thresholds

### Technical Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Polars 0.20+ for data processing (preferred over Pandas for performance)
- PyArrow 15.0+ for decimal128 support
- RocksDB 0.9+ for WAL implementation
- OpenTelemetry 1.24+ for metrics export

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Scripts: `scripts/run_delta_spike.py`, `scripts/bench_replay.py`, `scripts/analyze_io_requirements.py`
- Notebooks: `notebooks/decimal_pipeline_test.ipynb`
- Analysis module pattern: `src/rlx_datapipe/analysis/`
- Common utilities: `src/rlx_datapipe/common/`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- All functions must have unit tests in `tests/` mirroring src structure
- Integration tests should use fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`
- Must pass CI pipeline (Black formatting, Ruff linting)

### Performance Targets
[Source: TECHNICAL_VALIDATION_PLAN.md]
- Sequence gap ratio must be < 0.1% over 1-hour sample
- P95 memory usage must be < 24GB when processing 8M events
- Sustained throughput must be ≥ 100,000 events/second
- Disk I/O must sustain 150-200 MB/s for 20 hours

### Go/No-Go Criteria
If any of these fail:
1. Reassess feasibility of -5bp VWAP target
2. Consider fallback to SnapshotAnchoredStrategy
3. Re-estimate project timeline with architectural changes

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy.md]
- Test file location: `tests/analysis/test_delta_spike.py`, `tests/analysis/test_performance_baseline.py`
- Test framework: Pytest 8.2+
- Must include unit tests for all validation functions
- Integration tests should use small sample data in `tests/fixtures/`
- Performance tests must be reproducible and deterministic
