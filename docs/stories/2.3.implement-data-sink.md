# Story 2.3: Implement Data Sink

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** quantitative researcher,
**I want** the pipeline to save the processed unified event stream into partitioned Parquet files,
**so that** the backtesting environment can efficiently load and process the high-fidelity market data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The data sink writes events to Parquet files with decimal128(38,18) precision for all price/quantity fields
2. Files are partitioned by hour for optimal read performance and parallelism
3. Each partition file is between 100-500MB for efficient loading
4. Atomic writes ensure no partial files in case of crashes (write to temp, then rename)
5. The sink handles backpressure from upstream stages via queue-based flow control
6. File naming follows the pattern: `{symbol}/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}/events_{timestamp}.parquet`
7. A manifest file tracks all written partitions for easy discovery
8. Memory usage remains bounded during write operations
9. Write performance maintains pipeline throughput of 336K+ events/second

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.2 successfully implemented ChronologicalEventReplay and schema normalization
- UnifiedMarketEvent schema established with proper nullable fields for each event type
- Pipeline achieves ~20K events/second for full stateful processing
- Queue-based architecture enables backpressure between stages
- Configuration system (ReplayOptimizationConfig) provides tuning parameters

### Integration with Story 2.2
**Import Requirements**:
```python
from rlx_datapipe.reconstruction.event_replayer import ChronologicalEventReplay
from rlx_datapipe.reconstruction.schema_normalizer import UnifiedMarketEvent
from rlx_datapipe.reconstruction.config import ReplayOptimizationConfig
```

**Queue Configuration**:
- Input queue from ChronologicalEventReplay: `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=5000)`
- DataSink should await on queue.get() for backpressure handling
- Integrate with ReplayOptimizationConfig for batch size settings

### Data Models
**Unified Market Event Schema** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#lines-98-123]
```python
# Output schema from Story 2.2 that DataSink must handle
UnifiedMarketEvent = {
    # Core identifiers
    'event_timestamp': int64,  # Nanosecond precision
    'event_type': str,  # 'TRADE' | 'BOOK_SNAPSHOT' | 'BOOK_DELTA'
    'update_id': Optional[int64],
    
    # Trade-specific (null if not TRADE)
    'trade_id': Optional[int64],
    'trade_price': Optional[Decimal128],  # decimal128(38,18)
    'trade_quantity': Optional[Decimal128],  # decimal128(38,18)
    'trade_side': Optional[str],  # 'BUY' | 'SELL'
    
    # Book snapshot (null if not BOOK_SNAPSHOT)
    'bids': Optional[List[Tuple[Decimal128, Decimal128]]],
    'asks': Optional[List[Tuple[Decimal128, Decimal128]]],
    'is_snapshot': Optional[bool],
    
    # Book delta (null if not BOOK_DELTA)
    'delta_side': Optional[str],  # 'BID' | 'ASK'
    'delta_price': Optional[Decimal128],
    'delta_quantity': Optional[Decimal128]
}
```

- Manifest tracker: `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/manifest.py`
- Tests: `tests/reconstruction/test_data_sink.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/reconstruction/test_sink_integration.py`

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy.md#lines-5-9]
- **Test Framework**: Pytest for all test types
- **Test Location**: `tests/reconstruction/test_data_sink.py`
- **Unit Tests**: Test each method with mock event data
- **Integration Tests**: Use sample data from `tests/fixtures/`

- Monitor memory usage during batch accumulation
- Use streaming writes to avoid loading full datasets

**File System Operations**
- Use Path objects for cross-platform compatibility
- Ensure atomic operations with temp file + rename pattern

### Implementation Patterns
**Queue-Based Backpressure**
```python
async def process_events(self, input_queue: asyncio.Queue):
    batch = []
    while True:
        event = await input_queue.get()  # Blocks if queue empty
        batch.append(event)
        
        if len(batch) >= self.batch_size:
            await self.write_batch(batch)
            batch = []
```

**Atomic Write Pattern**
```python
def write_partition(self, df: pl.DataFrame, partition_path: Path):
    temp_path = partition_path.with_suffix('.tmp')
    df.write_parquet(temp_path, use_pyarrow=True)
    temp_path.rename(partition_path)  # Atomic on POSIX
```

**Manifest Update Pattern**
```python
def update_manifest(self, partition_info: dict):
    # Append to manifest with atomic write
    manifest_tmp = self.manifest_path.with_suffix('.tmp')
    with open(manifest_tmp, 'a') as f:
        json.dump(partition_info, f)
        f.write('\n')
    manifest_tmp.rename(self.manifest_path)
```

### Project Structure Notes
