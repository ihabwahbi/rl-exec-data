# Stakeholder Communication: Critical Project Update

## Subject: RLX Data Pipeline - Critical Course Correction Required

### Executive Summary

During our recent architectural review, we discovered that all validation work to date has been performed on **synthetic data** rather than actual market data from Crypto Lake. This represents a fundamental risk to project success. We are implementing an immediate course correction to ensure the pipeline is built on real market data.

### Key Discovery

- **What we thought**: Pipeline validation was complete and ready for implementation
- **What we found**: Validation used synthetic data; actual Crypto Lake access was never established
- **Impact**: All previous validation results are invalid and must be redone with real data

### Immediate Actions

1. **Full Stop on Development**: No implementation work will proceed until real data is acquired
2. **Data Acquisition Sprint**: 3-week focused effort to secure and validate actual market data
3. **Re-validation**: All previous analysis will be re-executed with real data

### Timeline Impact

**Previous Timeline**: 10-12 weeks from today
**Revised Timeline**: 14-20 weeks from today

The 4-8 week extension includes:
- 3 weeks: Data acquisition (Epic 0)
- 1-2 weeks: Re-validation with real data
- 0-3 weeks: Potential architecture adjustments based on real data characteristics

### Why This Is Critical

Building our RL trading agent on synthetic data would be like:
- Training a race car driver on a video game, then putting them in a real F1 car
- The agent would fail catastrophically when encountering real market conditions

By identifying this gap now, we're preventing:
- 2-3 months of wasted development effort
- Potential production failures that could impact trading performance
- Reputational damage from deploying an inadequately trained system

### Business Impact

**Short-term cost**: 4-8 week delay
**Long-term benefit**: 
- Confidence in achieving -5 basis points VWAP improvement target
- Robust system that handles real market conditions
- Avoided rework saving 2-3 months

### Success Metrics Remain Unchanged

- Process 12 months of historical data
- Statistical fidelity (K-S test p-value > 0.05)
- Support for complete market microstructure capture
- Enable RL agent to achieve ≤ -5 basis points VWAP slippage

### Next Steps

1. **This Week**: Secure Crypto Lake access and begin data acquisition
2. **Week 2-3**: Complete historical data download and validation
3. **Week 4**: Re-run all validation with real data
4. **Week 5**: Go/No-Go decision based on actual data characteristics

### Risk Mitigation

We've implemented multiple safeguards:
- Blocking gates preventing work without data
- Comprehensive validation checklist
- Daily progress reporting during acquisition
- Clear escalation paths for issues

### Your Action Required

1. **Approval**: Confirm acceptance of revised timeline
2. **Budget**: Approve Crypto Lake data costs (estimated: $X,XXX)
3. **Resources**: Confirm team availability for 3-week data sprint

### Key Message

This is not a setback—it's prudent risk management. By ensuring our foundation is solid, we're dramatically increasing the probability of achieving our business objectives. The cost of getting this wrong in production far exceeds the cost of getting it right now.

**Bottom Line**: We're investing 4-8 weeks now to avoid 2-3 months of rework later, while ensuring the system actually achieves its -5bp VWAP improvement target in production.
