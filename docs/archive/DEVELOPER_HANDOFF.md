# Developer Handoff - Critical Path Forward

## Immediate Action Required

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Story 1.2.5 Must Be Completed FIRST

**Story Location**: `/docs/stories/1.2.5.technical-validation-spike.md`

This validation spike is our Go/No-Go gate. DO NOT proceed with any other stories until this is complete.

## Why This Is Critical

Recent expert reviews identified two show-stopper risks:
1. **Delta Feed Viability**: Can we process 8M events/hour within 24GB RAM?
2. **Decimal Precision**: Will Polars decimal128 or int64 pips work at scale?

Without validating these assumptions, we risk 2+ months of wasted effort.

## Your Task

Implement Story 1.2.5 completely. This includes:

1. **Delta Feed Analysis Script** (`scripts/run_delta_spike.py`)
   - Analyze book_delta_v2 data for sequence gaps
   - Measure memory usage and throughput
   - Output JSON metrics report

2. **Decimal Pipeline Test** (`notebooks/decimal_pipeline_test.ipynb`)
   - Test Polars decimal128 operations at scale
   - Implement int64 pips fallback if needed
   - Benchmark both approaches

3. **Performance Baseline** (`scripts/bench_replay.py`)
   - End-to-end pipeline simulation
   - Must achieve ≥100k events/sec

4. **Hardware Validation**
   - ALL tests must run on Beelink S12 Pro
   - Monitor memory, CPU, and disk I/O

## Success Criteria

The validation passes if ALL of these are true:
- ✅ Sequence gap ratio < 0.1%
- ✅ P95 memory usage < 24GB
- ✅ Sustained throughput ≥ 100k events/sec
- ✅ Decimal strategy validated (either decimal128 OR int64 pips)

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Implement all validation scripts and tests
- **End of Week 1**: Run on Beelink hardware
- **Week 2 Day 1-2**: Complete decimal strategy testing
- **Week 2 Day 4**: Compile results and make Go/No-Go recommendation

## What Happens Next

### If Validation PASSES:
1. We update Story 1.2 with new requirements
2. Proceed with Epic 2 using validated approach
3. Full steam ahead!

### If Validation FAILS:
1. We pivot architecture based on findings
2. Adjust project scope with stakeholders
3. Create new validation spike for alternative approach

## DO NOT:
- ❌ Work on Story 1.2 (Live Capture) - it needs updates based on validation
- ❌ Start Epic 2 stories - they depend on validation results
- ❌ Make assumptions - gather data and report findings

## Questions?

The Story 1.2.5 document is comprehensive and self-contained. All technical details, file locations, and acceptance criteria are included.

Remember: This 2-week validation saves potentially 2 months of rework. Be thorough!
