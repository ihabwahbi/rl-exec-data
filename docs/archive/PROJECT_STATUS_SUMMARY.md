# RLX Data Pipeline - Project Status Summary

## 🚨 Current Status: DATA ACQUISITION BLOCKING - No Work Can Proceed

### Critical Discovery
**The project has been operating on synthetic data**. All previous validation work is invalid. Epic 0 (Data Acquisition) is now the absolute blocking prerequisite before ANY other work can continue.

### What Actually Happened ❌
1. **Story 1.1 Invalid**: Origin time analysis was performed on SYNTHETIC data - must be redone with real data
2. **Story 1.2 Cannot Proceed**: Cannot capture live data without first having historical data for comparison
3. **Validation Spike Blocked**: Cannot validate delta feeds without actual Crypto Lake data
4. **Fundamental Execution Gap**: Team validated pipeline with synthetic data while real data was never acquired

### Current Reality Check 🔴
- **Crypto Lake Access**: UNVERIFIED
- **Historical Data**: NONE ACQUIRED
- **Valid Analysis**: NONE (all based on synthetic data)
- **Timeline Impact**: +3-6 weeks for data acquisition

### Epic 0: Data Acquisition [ABSOLUTE BLOCKER]

#### Immediate Actions Required (THIS WEEK):
1. **TODAY - Verify Crypto Lake Status**
   - [ ] Check subscription status
   - [ ] Identify who has API credentials
   - [ ] Verify available data inventory
   - [ ] Get budget approval for data costs

2. **Within 48 Hours**
   - [ ] Test API authentication
   - [ ] Download 1-day sample to verify format
   - [ ] Estimate full download time/cost
   - [ ] Set up data staging infrastructure

3. **Week 1 Completion Target**
   - [ ] Full authentication verified
   - [ ] Download pipeline tested
   - [ ] 1-2 weeks of data acquired
   - [ ] Initial integrity validation

### Revised Project Timeline

```
Weeks 1-3: Epic 0 - Data Acquisition [CURRENT PHASE]
├── Week 1: Access & Setup
├── Week 2: Download 12 months BTC-USDT
└── Week 3: Validation & Readiness Certification

Weeks 4-5: Epic 1 - Analysis with REAL Data
├── Re-execute Story 1.1 (origin_time analysis)
├── Story 1.2: Live capture setup
└── Story 1.2.5: Delta validation spike

Week 6-7: Go/No-Go Decision
└── Based on ACTUAL data characteristics

Weeks 8-14: Implementation (if Go)
└── Epic 2 & 3 development
```

### Why This Happened
- PRD v1.3/1.4 identified this gap but was updated AFTER validation work began
- Architecture assumed data existed
- No blocking gates were enforced in practice

### Key Success Metrics (Updated)
**Phase 0 Success Required**:
- ✅ Crypto Lake access verified
- ✅ 12 months data downloaded
- ✅ All integrity checks passed
- ✅ Data readiness certified

**ONLY THEN** can we validate:
- Delta feed viability
- Decimal128 performance  
- Memory constraints
- Throughput targets

### Key Documentation Updates

#### PRD Changes (v1.2):
- Added NFR6: Throughput requirement (≥100k events/sec)
- Added NFR7: Data retention and security policy
- Updated FR3: Require 3 distinct 24-hour golden samples
- Expanded Story 1.2.5: Comprehensive validation spike

#### Architecture Changes (v1.2):
- Simplified WAL: Parquet segments instead of RocksDB
- Added bounded queue pattern for backpressure
- Documented int64 pips fallback strategy
- Added implementation notes throughout

### Risk Summary

**High Impact Risks:**
1. Delta feeds may have unacceptable gaps
2. Polars decimal128 may not be production-ready
3. Disk I/O may not sustain required throughput

**Mitigation:**
- Validation spike addresses all risks upfront
- Fallback strategies documented
- Clear Go/No-Go criteria established

### Team Communication

**Key Message**: We are ~90% ready but MUST validate two critical assumptions before full implementation. This 2-day validation could save 2 months of rework.

**Stakeholder Update Needed**:
- Validation gate inserted before Epic 2
- Potential 1-week delay for prudent risk management
- -5bp target contingent on delta feed success

### Success Criteria

The project succeeds if:
1. We can capture complete market microstructure (>99.9% fidelity)
2. We can process 12 months of data with deterministic results
3. The RL agent achieves -5bp VWAP improvement using our data

### Current Recommendation

**HOLD** on Epic 2 implementation until validation completes. This is prudent engineering, not delay - we're investing 2 days to save potentially 2 months.
