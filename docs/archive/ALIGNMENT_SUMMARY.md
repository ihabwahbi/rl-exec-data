# Project Alignment Summary - Data Acquisition First

## Current Situation

### ‚ùå What We Thought
- Story 1.1 (Origin Time Analysis) - Complete ‚úÖ
- Story 1.2.5 (Technical Validation) - Complete ‚úÖ
- Ready to proceed with Epic 2 implementation

### ‚úÖ What Is Actually True
- Story 1.1 - **INVALID** (done on synthetic data)
- Story 1.2.5 - **INVALID** (done on synthetic data)
- **Epic 0 (Data Acquisition) - NOT STARTED** üö®

## Critical Alignment Points

### 1. **Immediate Priority: Epic 0 - Data Acquisition**
No other work can proceed until we have real Crypto Lake data. This is an absolute blocker.

### 2. **Good News: Credentials Are Ready**
- `.env` file contains Crypto Lake AWS credentials
- Authentication pattern is documented
- Test script is ready to verify connection

### 3. **Clear Implementation Path**
We have created:
- **Story 0.1**: Complete implementation guide for data acquisition pipeline
- **Technical Guide**: Specific Crypto Lake S3 integration patterns
- **Test Script**: Immediate verification of access

## Next Actions (In Order)

### Today - Verify Access
```bash
# Run this immediately to test Crypto Lake connection
python scripts/test_crypto_lake_connection.py
```

### This Week - Implement Pipeline
1. Follow Story 0.1 implementation tasks
2. Use CRYPTO_LAKE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md for S3 specifics
3. Download 1-day sample first
4. Validate data format and schema

### Week 2-3 - Full Data Acquisition
1. Download 12 months BTC-USDT data
2. Validate all data integrity
3. Issue data readiness certificate
4. Update PROJECT_STATUS_SUMMARY

### Week 4+ - Resume Epic 1 with Real Data
1. Re-run Story 1.1 with actual data
2. Complete Story 1.2 live capture
3. Execute Story 1.2.5 validation
4. Make Go/No-Go decision

## Key Technical Details

### AWS Authentication
```python
# Already configured in .env
aws_access_key_id=your_key
aws_secret_access_key=your_secret

# Load pattern (already implemented)
load_dotenv()
os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = os.getenv('aws_access_key_id')
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = os.getenv('aws_secret_access_key')
```

### Expected Data Structure
- **Bucket**: To be discovered via test script
- **Path Pattern**: Likely `exchange/symbol/data_type/year/month/day/`
- **File Format**: Parquet files
- **Data Types**: trades, book, book_delta_v2

### Implementation Components
1. **CryptoLakeS3Client** - AWS S3 authentication and bucket discovery
2. **DataDownloader** - Robust download with retry and progress tracking
3. **DataValidator** - Schema and integrity validation
4. **DataStagingManager** - Lifecycle management (raw ‚Üí ready)
5. **CLI Interface** - Easy-to-use command line tools

## Success Criteria

### Phase 0 Complete When:
‚úÖ Crypto Lake connection verified  
‚úÖ 12 months BTC-USDT data downloaded  
‚úÖ All data passes validation  
‚úÖ Data staging area organized  
‚úÖ Readiness certificate issued  

### Only Then Can We:
- Re-execute Story 1.1 with real data
- Proceed with Story 1.2 and 1.2.5
- Make informed architecture decisions
- Begin Epic 2 implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### If Connection Fails
1. Verify credentials in .env file
2. Check Crypto Lake subscription status
3. Contact Crypto Lake support
4. Escalate to management immediately

### If Data Quality Issues
1. Document all issues found
2. Determine if acceptable for PoC
3. Get stakeholder sign-off
4. Adjust validation thresholds if needed

## Communication

### Daily Updates Required
- Progress on data download
- Any blockers encountered
- ETA for completion
- Data quality observations

### Stakeholder Message
"We discovered all previous validation used synthetic data. We're now acquiring real Crypto Lake data (3 weeks) before proceeding. This ensures our pipeline will work with actual market conditions and prevents months of potential rework."

## Conclusion

**We are aligned on the critical path forward:**
1. Data acquisition is the absolute first priority
2. No other work proceeds until real data is acquired
3. All previous "completed" work must be redone with real data
4. Timeline extends by 3-6 weeks but prevents catastrophic failure

**The good news:** We caught this early, have credentials ready, and have a clear implementation path. Let's execute!
