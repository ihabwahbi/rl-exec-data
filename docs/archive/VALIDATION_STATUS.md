# Validation Phase Status Board

## Current Phase: VALIDATION (Story 1.2.5)

### Critical Path Tracker

```
Story 1.1 ✅ → Story 1.2.5 🚧 → [Go/No-Go Gate] → Story 1.2 → Epic 2
```

## Story 1.2.5: Technical Validation Spike

### Objectives
Validate two show-stopper assumptions before Epic 2:
1. Delta feed integrity and throughput capability
2. Decimal128 toolchain maturity in Polars

### Validation Checklist

#### Week 1 Tasks
- [ ] Implement `scripts/run_delta_spike.py`
- [ ] Run delta analysis on 1-hour high-volume sample
- [ ] Deploy to Beelink S12 Pro hardware
- [ ] Run 8-hour continuous test
- [ ] Implement `notebooks/decimal_pipeline_test.ipynb`
- [ ] Test Polars decimal128 operations
- [ ] Implement int64 pips converter if needed

#### Week 2 Tasks
- [ ] Implement `scripts/bench_replay.py`
- [ ] Run end-to-end performance tests
- [ ] Create `scripts/analyze_io_requirements.py`
- [ ] Calculate 12-month processing requirements
- [ ] Configure multi-regime live capture
- [ ] Compile validation results
- [ ] Make Go/No-Go decision

### Success Metrics Dashboard

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Sequence Gap Ratio | < 0.1% | TBD | 🔄 |
| P95 Memory Usage | < 24GB | TBD | 🔄 |
| Throughput | ≥ 100k events/sec | TBD | 🔄 |
| Disk I/O | 150-200 MB/s sustained | TBD | 🔄 |
| Decimal Operations | No object dtype fallback | TBD | 🔄 |

### Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

✅ **GO** if ALL metrics pass:
- Proceed to updated Story 1.2
- Begin Epic 2 with streaming architecture
- Target -5bp VWAP improvement achievable

❌ **NO-GO** if ANY metric fails:
- Document specific failures
- Implement fallback architecture
- Adjust project timeline and scope
- Potentially reduce to -3bp VWAP target

## Risk Register

### High Priority Risks
1. **Delta Feed Gaps** - If >0.1%, microstructure incomplete
2. **Memory Overflow** - If >24GB, cannot run on target hardware
3. **Throughput Bottleneck** - If <100k eps, cannot process 12 months

### Mitigation Strategies Ready
- Hybrid snapshot+delta approach
- Int64 pips instead of decimal128
- Distributed processing fallback
- Increased hardware specs

## Next Actions

1. **Developer**: Start Story 1.2.5 implementation immediately
2. **PM**: Prepare stakeholder communication for potential Go/No-Go outcomes
3. **Architect**: Stand by to update architecture based on findings
4. **QA**: Prepare validation test scenarios

## Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Week 1 Day 1-2 | Delta analysis implementation |
| Week 1 Day 3 | Hardware deployment and testing |
| Week 1 Day 4-5 | Decimal strategy implementation |
| Week 2 Day 1-2 | Performance benchmarking |
| Week 2 Day 3 | Multi-regime capture setup |
| Week 2 Day 4 | **Go/No-Go Decision** |
| Week 2 Day 5 | Architecture updates based on decision |

**Remember**: This 2-week investment prevents 2+ months of potential rework. Be thorough, be honest about results, and make data-driven decisions.
