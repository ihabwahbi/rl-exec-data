# Adaptive Architecture Strategy

## Overview

This document defines how the RLX Data Pipeline architecture will adapt based on empirical validation results. Rather than committing to a single approach upfront, we'll make data-driven decisions at key points.

## Decision Tree Framework

```
Validation Results → Architectural Decision → Implementation Path
```

## Key Decision Points

### 1. Origin Time Reliability (Story 1.1)

**Validation**: Analyze origin_time completeness in real Crypto Lake data

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF origin_time invalid rate < 0.1% THEN
    → Use simple timestamp-based merging
    → Architecture: Lightweight chronological sorter
    
ELIF origin_time invalid rate < 5% THEN
    → Use timestamp with fallback logic
    → Architecture: Smart merger with interpolation
    
ELSE
    → Use snapshot-anchored approach
    → Architecture: Stateful reconstruction engine
```

### 2. WebSocket Stream Behavior (Story 1.2)

**Validation**: Compare combined vs separate stream ordering

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF combined streams show 0% out-of-order THEN
    → Use single combined connection
    → Architecture: Simple event router
    
ELIF out-of-order rate < 1% THEN
    → Use combined with reordering buffer
    → Architecture: Small ordering window
    
ELSE
    → Use separate streams with synchronization
    → Architecture: Complex event correlator
```

### 3. Delta Feed Completeness (Story 1.2.5)

**Validation**: Analyze book_delta_v2 gaps and coverage

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF gap ratio < 0.1% AND memory < 20GB THEN
    → Use full event reconstruction
    → Architecture: Event-driven order book engine
    
ELIF gap ratio < 1% OR memory < 28GB THEN
    → Use hybrid approach (deltas + periodic snapshots)
    → Architecture: Checkpoint-based reconstruction
    
ELSE
    → Use snapshot-only approach
    → Architecture: Interpolation engine
```

### 4. Performance Characteristics

**Validation**: Benchmark throughput and memory usage

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF throughput > 200k events/sec AND memory < 20GB THEN
    → Use in-memory processing
    → Architecture: Single-pass pipeline
    
ELIF throughput > 100k events/sec AND memory < 28GB THEN
    → Use streaming with buffering
    → Architecture: Multi-stage pipeline
    
ELSE
    → Use disk-based streaming
    → Architecture: Spill-to-disk pipeline
```

### 5. Decimal Precision Strategy

**Validation**: Benchmark Decimal128 vs int64 performance

**Decision Tree**:
```
IF Decimal128 overhead < 10% THEN
    → Use Decimal128 throughout
    → Architecture: Native decimal pipeline
    
ELIF Decimal128 overhead < 50% THEN
    → Use Decimal128 for critical paths only
    → Architecture: Mixed precision pipeline
    
ELSE
    → Use int64 pips representation
    → Architecture: Integer pipeline with conversion
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Progressive Enhancement
Start with simplest viable approach, add complexity only when validated necessary:

```python
class AdaptiveMerger:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategy = self._select_strategy()
    
    def _select_strategy(self):
        if ValidationResults.origin_time_reliability > 0.999:
            return SimpleTimestampMerger()
        elif ValidationResults.origin_time_reliability > 0.95:
            return SmartTimestampMerger()
        else:
            return SnapshotAnchoredMerger()
```

### Pattern 2: Feature Flags
Use configuration to switch between implementations:

```yaml
pipeline_config:
  merger:
    strategy: "${VALIDATION_MERGER_STRATEGY}"
  decimal:
    use_decimal128: "${VALIDATION_DECIMAL_FEASIBLE}"
  streaming:
    window_size: "${VALIDATION_MEMORY_WINDOW}"
```

### Pattern 3: Pluggable Components
Design interfaces that allow swapping implementations:

```python
class OrderBookEngine(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def process_update(self, update: Update) -> None:
        pass

class FullEventEngine(OrderBookEngine):
    """Used when delta feed is complete"""
    
class SnapshotEngine(OrderBookEngine):
    """Used when only snapshots available"""
    
class HybridEngine(OrderBookEngine):
    """Used for mixed approach"""
```

## Validation Integration Points

### Continuous Validation
- Run validation suite on every significant change
- Track metrics over time
- Alert on degradation

### Decision Documentation
- Record why each decision was made
- Link to validation data
- Enable decision replay

### Rollback Capability
- Keep previous implementations available
- A/B test new approaches
- Quick reversion if issues found

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Parallel Development
- Build multiple approaches in parallel
- Choose based on validation results
- Minimize wasted work

### 2. Incremental Validation
- Validate most critical assumptions first
- Make architectural decisions early
- Refine based on additional data

### 3. Defensive Architecture
- Design for the worst case
- Optimize when validated safe
- Always have fallback options

## Timeline Integration

### Week 1: Foundation Validation
- Origin time reliability (informs merger design)
- WebSocket behavior (informs connection architecture)
- Basic performance baseline

### Week 2: Deep Validation
- Delta feed completeness
- Memory usage patterns
- Throughput characteristics

### Week 3: Final Decisions
- Select optimal approaches
- Document rationale
- Plan Epic 2 implementation

## Success Metrics

The adaptive strategy succeeds when:
1. ✅ Every architectural decision has validation data
2. ✅ Multiple implementation options are available
3. ✅ Switching between approaches is low-cost
4. ✅ Performance meets requirements with simplest approach
5. ✅ Team understands decision rationale

## Communication Plan

### Decision Communication
1. Validation results summary
2. Decision tree outcome
3. Implementation selection
4. Risk assessment
5. Next steps

### Stakeholder Updates
- Weekly validation reports
- Decision points highlighted
- Timeline impacts assessed
- Risk registry updated

## Long-term Evolution

This adaptive approach positions us for:
- Market changes (new data types, formats)
- Scale changes (more symbols, higher frequency)
- Requirement changes (new metrics, constraints)
- Technology changes (better libraries, hardware)

The key principle: **Build for change, validate before commitment**
