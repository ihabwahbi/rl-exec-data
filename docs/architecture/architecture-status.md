# Architecture Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-19  
**Current Phase**: Epic 0 Complete, Epic 1 Ready

## Executive Summary

The RLX Data Pipeline architecture has successfully guided the implementation of Epic 0 (Data Acquisition). With real Crypto Lake data now accessible, the architecture pivots to support Epic 1 implementation while maintaining alignment with validated technical constraints.

## Architecture Evolution

### From Theory to Reality

The architecture has evolved through several critical phases:

1. **Initial Design (v1.0-v1.3)**: Theoretical architecture based on assumptions
2. **Data-First Revision (v1.4)**: Recognized need for real data before validation
3. **Current State**: Epic 0 complete, architecture validated with real data

### Key Learnings from Epic 0

**Data Characteristics Discovered**:
- Crypto Lake schema: 8 columns (simpler than expected)
- Data volume: 2.3M trades = 41.1 MB (manageable size)
- Download performance: 34.3 MB/s (exceeds requirements)
- Available data: 3.3M trades, 2M book, 102M book_delta_v2 rows

**Technical Validations**:
- lakeapi package works reliably (better than direct S3)
- Error handling patterns proven with 49% test coverage
- CLI architecture successful with Click framework
- Staging area pattern effective for data management

## Component Status

### 1. DataAcquisition ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Purpose**: Download and stage Crypto Lake historical data
- **Status**: Complete with production-ready implementation
- **Key Files**:
  - `/src/rlx_datapipe/acquisition/crypto_lake_client.py`
  - `/src/rlx_datapipe/acquisition/data_downloader.py`
  - `/scripts/acquire_data_lakeapi.py`

### 2. DataAssessor ‚è≥ READY TO START
- **Purpose**: Analyze data quality and characteristics
- **Next**: Story 1.1 - Analyze origin_time completeness
- **Dependencies**: Requires real data from DataAcquisition

### 3. LiveCapture ‚è≥ PENDING
- **Purpose**: Capture golden samples from Binance
- **Next**: Story 1.2 - Implement after origin_time analysis
- **Key Requirement**: Combined stream architecture per Gemini research

### 4. Reconstructor ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED
- **Purpose**: Transform historical data to unified stream
- **Blocked By**: Epic 1 validation results
- **Critical Decision**: Delta feed viability (Story 1.2.5)

### 5. FidelityReporter ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED
- **Purpose**: Validate reconstruction quality
- **Blocked By**: Reconstructor implementation
- **Design**: Metrics catalog defined in research

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Validated Decisions ‚úÖ
1. **Python + Polars**: Proven effective for data processing
2. **Click CLI**: Clean command interface implementation
3. **Pytest**: Achieved 49% coverage with good patterns
4. **Staging Area**: Effective data management approach

### Pending Validations üîç
1. **Decimal Strategy**: Decimal128 vs int64 pips (Story 1.2.5)
2. **Streaming Architecture**: Memory constraints with real data
3. **Delta Feed Processing**: Viability and gap analysis
4. **Performance Targets**: 100k events/sec achievable?

## Architecture Alignment with PRD

### Synchronized Elements ‚úÖ
- Epic 0 completion status
- Real data characteristics
- Timeline adjustments
- Next phase priorities

### Architecture-Specific Concerns
1. **Memory Management**: 28GB constraint not yet validated
2. **Throughput Testing**: Need real data performance baseline
3. **Schema Evolution**: Strategy for handling changes
4. **Operational Procedures**: Monitoring and maintenance

## Risk Mitigation Updates

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Delta feed gaps | High | Story 1.2.5 validation | üîç Pending |
| Memory overflow | High | Streaming architecture | üîç To validate |
| Decimal precision | Medium | Int64 fallback ready | üîç To test |
| Schema changes | Medium | Version detection | üìã To design |

## Epic 1 Architecture Guidance

### Story 1.1: Origin Time Analysis
**Architecture Requirements**:
- Load real Crypto Lake data efficiently
- Analyze timestamp completeness
- Report statistics for both trades and book tables

**Implementation Pattern**:
```python
# Use proven DataDownloader patterns
# Leverage Polars for efficient analysis
# Follow established error handling
```

### Story 1.2: Live Capture Design
**Critical Architecture Elements** (from Gemini research):
- Combined WebSocket stream mandatory
- Order book initialization protocol
- Chronological event ordering
- State management for book maintenance

### Story 1.2.5: Technical Validation
**Architecture Validation Points**:
- Memory profiling with 1-hour data (8M events)
- Throughput testing (target: 100k events/sec)
- Decimal128 operations at scale
- I/O performance for 220GB monthly data

## Next Architecture Updates

Based on Epic 1 results, architecture will need:

1. **Performance Baselines**: Document actual vs. theoretical
2. **Memory Patterns**: Streaming window sizing
3. **Error Recovery**: Patterns from production usage
4. **Operational Procedures**: Based on real data experience

## Architecture Documentation Standards

To prevent future documentation sprawl:

### Document Hierarchy
1. **This Status Document**: Single source of truth for current state
2. **Component Specs**: Detailed design per component
3. **Implementation Guides**: Story-specific guidance
4. **Decision Records**: Immutable architecture decisions

### Update Protocol
1. All updates start in this status document
2. Component changes update specific component docs
3. Completed work moves to changelog
4. Outdated docs move to archive

### File Organization
