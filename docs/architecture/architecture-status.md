# Architecture Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-21  
**Current Phase**: Epic 1 Complete - Ready for Epic 2 Implementation

## ‚úÖ Architecture Validation Success

The validation-first pivot has proven highly successful. With Epic 1 100% complete, we have strong empirical foundations with 11.15M golden samples, a comprehensive validation framework (91% test coverage), and validated performance exceeding requirements by 130x. Delta feed validation showed perfect results with 0% sequence gaps.

## Executive Summary

Epic 0 (Data Acquisition) is complete and Epic 1 has successfully established the validation foundation. The architecture has evolved from theory to empirically-validated patterns with comprehensive golden samples and a production-ready validation framework. All technical risks have been validated with GO decision for Epic 2 FullReconstruction strategy.

## Architecture Evolution

### From Theory to Reality

The architecture has evolved through several critical phases:

1. **Initial Design (v1.0-v1.3)**: Theoretical architecture based on assumptions
2. **Data-First Revision (v1.4)**: Recognized need for real data before validation
3. **Current State**: Epic 0 complete, architecture validated with real data

### Key Learnings from Epic 0

**Data Characteristics Discovered**:
- Crypto Lake schema: 8 columns (simpler than expected)
- Data volume: 2.3M trades = 41.1 MB (manageable size)
- Download performance: 34.3 MB/s (exceeds requirements)
- Available data: 3.3M trades, 2M book, 102M book_delta_v2 rows

**Technical Validations**:
- lakeapi package works reliably (better than direct S3)
- Error handling patterns proven with 49% test coverage
- CLI architecture successful with Click framework
- Staging area pattern effective for data management

## Critical Issues from Story 1.2 Implementation

### What Was Built vs What Was Needed
1. **Output Format**: Transformed data instead of raw preservation
   - Built: `{"type": "trade", "price": "...", "quantity": "..."}`
   - Needed: `{"capture_ns": 123, "stream": "btcusdt@trade", "data": {raw}}`

2. **WebSocket URL**: Missing critical @100ms suffix
   - Built: `btcusdt@depth`
   - Needed: `btcusdt@depth@100ms`

3. **Architecture Over-engineering**: Complex parsing when simple capture needed

### Root Cause: Assumption-Driven Development
- Developer interpreted requirements based on assumptions
- No empirical validation framework to catch misunderstandings early
- Research findings not effectively integrated into specifications
