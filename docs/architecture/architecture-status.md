# Architecture Status

> **📌 MASTER SUMMARY**: This document is the master summary of the architectural status. For detailed specifications, please refer to the linked component and strategy documents.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01  
**Current Phase**: Epic 3 In Progress - High-Fidelity Validation (Architecture Updated)

## ✅ Architecture Validation Success

The validation-first pivot has proven highly successful. With Epic 1 100% complete, we have strong empirical foundations with 11.15M golden samples, a comprehensive validation framework (91% test coverage), and validated performance exceeding requirements by 130x. Delta feed validation showed perfect results with 0% sequence gaps across all market regimes.

## Executive Summary

Epic 0 (Data Acquisition) and Epic 1 (Validation) are complete, and now Epic 2 (Reconstruction Pipeline) has been successfully implemented. The architecture has evolved from theory to fully operational components with validated performance exceeding all requirements. The pipeline achieves 336-345K messages/second throughput with comprehensive features including multi-symbol support, checkpointing, and atomic data handling.

## Architecture Evolution

### From Theory to Reality

The architecture has evolved through several critical phases:

1. **Initial Design (v1.0-v1.3)**: Theoretical architecture based on assumptions
2. **Data-First Revision (v1.4)**: Recognized need for real data before validation
3. **Current State**: Epic 2 complete, performance validated at 345K msg/s (3.45x requirement)

### Performance Achievements

| Metric | Target | Validated Baseline | Status |
|--------|--------|--------------------|--------|
| Throughput | 100,000 events/sec | 12.97M events/sec | ✅ 130x above target |
| Memory Usage | < 24GB sustained | 1.67GB for 8M events | ✅ 14x safety margin |
| I/O Read | 150-200 MB/s | 7.75GB/s | ✅ 40x above target |
| I/O Write | 150-200 MB/s | 3.07GB/s | ✅ 15x above target |
| Processing Time | 20 hours for 12mo | 0.27 days (6.5 hours) | ✅ 3x faster |
| Checkpoint Overhead | < 5% | < 1% | ✅ Exceeds requirement |

### Key Learnings from Epic 0

**Data Characteristics Discovered**:
- Crypto Lake schema: 8 columns (simpler than expected)
- Data volume: 2.3M trades = 41.1 MB (manageable size)
- Download performance: 34.3 MB/s (exceeds requirements)
- Available data: 3.3M trades, 2M book, 102M book_delta_v2 rows

**Technical Validations**:
- lakeapi package works reliably (better than direct S3)
- Error handling patterns proven with 49% test coverage
- CLI architecture successful with Click framework
- Staging area pattern effective for data management

## Critical Issues from Story 1.2 Implementation

### What Was Built vs What Was Needed
1. **Output Format**: Transformed data instead of raw preservation
   - Built: `{"type": "trade", "price": "...", "quantity": "..."}`
   - Needed: `{"capture_ns": 123, "stream": "btcusdt@trade", "data": {raw}}`

2. **WebSocket URL**: Missing critical @100ms suffix
   - Built: `btcusdt@depth`
   - Needed: `btcusdt@depth@100ms`

3. **Architecture Over-engineering**: Complex parsing when simple capture needed

### Root Cause: Assumption-Driven Development
- Developer interpreted requirements based on assumptions
- No empirical validation framework to catch misunderstandings early
- Research findings not effectively integrated into specifications

## Epic 3 Architecture Guidance

### Critical Architecture Updates Required

**⚠️ FidelityReporter Component Missing**: Review reveals FidelityReporter is 0% implemented - only validation framework exists. This is a critical blocker for Epic 3.

### Building on Epic 2 Foundation
With the reconstruction pipeline complete, Epic 3 requires significant new development:

1. **Build FidelityReporter from Scratch**: No existing implementation, need full component
2. **Implement 60% Missing Metrics**: Most microstructure and statistical metrics not built
3. **Create Visual Reporting**: Charts and dashboards not implemented
4. **Validate Research Claims**: Measure actual vs theoretical benefits

### Undocumented Patterns Discovered
The following patterns were implemented in Epic 2 but not documented:
- **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**: Crash recovery mechanism
- **Memory-Mapped I/O**: Performance optimization for file operations
- **Pipeline State Provider**: Interface abstraction pattern
- **Drift Tracking**: Continuous accuracy monitoring
- **Multi-Symbol Architecture**: Process-per-symbol for GIL avoidance

## Next Architecture Updates

Based on Epic 1 results, architecture will need:

1. **Performance Baselines**: Document actual vs. theoretical
2. **Memory Patterns**: Streaming window sizing
3. **Error Recovery**: Patterns from production usage
4. **Operational Procedures**: Based on real data experience
