# Architecture Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-19  
**Current Phase**: Validation Foundation - Critical Issues Discovered

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Status Update

Story 1.2 implementation revealed fundamental misunderstandings between specification and implementation. Architecture must pivot to a **validation-first approach** based on empirical evidence rather than assumptions.

## Executive Summary

While Epic 0 (Data Acquisition) is complete, Story 1.2 implementation issues have exposed a critical gap: we've been building based on theoretical understanding rather than empirical validation. The architecture must evolve to establish a solid foundation through systematic validation before proceeding with complex reconstruction.

## Architecture Evolution

### From Theory to Reality

The architecture has evolved through several critical phases:

1. **Initial Design (v1.0-v1.3)**: Theoretical architecture based on assumptions
2. **Data-First Revision (v1.4)**: Recognized need for real data before validation
3. **Current State**: Epic 0 complete, architecture validated with real data

### Key Learnings from Epic 0

**Data Characteristics Discovered**:
- Crypto Lake schema: 8 columns (simpler than expected)
- Data volume: 2.3M trades = 41.1 MB (manageable size)
- Download performance: 34.3 MB/s (exceeds requirements)
- Available data: 3.3M trades, 2M book, 102M book_delta_v2 rows

**Technical Validations**:
- lakeapi package works reliably (better than direct S3)
- Error handling patterns proven with 49% test coverage
- CLI architecture successful with Click framework
- Staging area pattern effective for data management

## Critical Issues from Story 1.2 Implementation

### What Was Built vs What Was Needed
1. **Output Format**: Transformed data instead of raw preservation
   - Built: `{"type": "trade", "price": "...", "quantity": "..."}`
   - Needed: `{"capture_ns": 123, "stream": "btcusdt@trade", "data": {raw}}`

2. **WebSocket URL**: Missing critical @100ms suffix
   - Built: `btcusdt@depth`
   - Needed: `btcusdt@depth@100ms`

3. **Architecture Over-engineering**: Complex parsing when simple capture needed

### Root Cause: Assumption-Driven Development
- Developer interpreted requirements based on assumptions
- No empirical validation framework to catch misunderstandings early
- Research findings not effectively integrated into specifications

## Component Status - Revised

### 1. DataAcquisition ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Purpose**: Download and stage Crypto Lake historical data
- **Status**: Complete with production-ready implementation
- **Key Files**:
  - `/src/rlx_datapipe/acquisition/crypto_lake_client.py`
  - `/src/rlx_datapipe/acquisition/data_downloader.py`
  - `/scripts/acquire_data_lakeapi.py`

### 2. DataAssessor ‚ùå NEEDS RE-EXECUTION
- **Purpose**: Analyze data quality and characteristics
- **Issue**: Story 1.1 executed with synthetic data, not real data
- **Action**: Re-execute with actual Crypto Lake data

### 3. LiveCapture ‚ùå NEEDS FIXES
- **Purpose**: Capture golden samples from Binance
- **Issues**: Wrong output format, missing @100ms, wrong location
- **Critical**: Must preserve raw messages for validation

### 4. ValidationFramework üÜï NEW COMPONENT NEEDED
- **Purpose**: Empirically validate all assumptions
- **Components**:
  - Statistical test suite
  - Research claim validator
  - Automated comparison tools
  - Fidelity report generator

### 5. Reconstructor ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED
- **Purpose**: Transform historical data to unified stream
- **Blocked By**: Validation framework results
- **Decision Point**: Approach depends on empirical findings

### 6. FidelityReporter ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED
- **Purpose**: Validate reconstruction quality
- **Blocked By**: Need golden samples first
- **Integration**: Part of ValidationFramework

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Validated Decisions ‚úÖ
1. **Python + Polars**: Proven effective for data processing
2. **Click CLI**: Clean command interface implementation
3. **Pytest**: Achieved 49% coverage with good patterns
4. **Staging Area**: Effective data management approach

### Pending Validations üîç
1. **Decimal Strategy**: Decimal128 vs int64 pips (Story 1.2.5)
2. **Streaming Architecture**: Memory constraints with real data
3. **Delta Feed Processing**: Viability and gap analysis
4. **Performance Targets**: 100k events/sec achievable?

## Architecture Alignment with PRD

### Synchronized Elements ‚úÖ
- Epic 0 completion status
- Real data characteristics
- Timeline adjustments
- Next phase priorities

### Architecture-Specific Concerns
1. **Memory Management**: 28GB constraint not yet validated
2. **Throughput Testing**: Need real data performance baseline
3. **Schema Evolution**: Strategy for handling changes
4. **Operational Procedures**: Monitoring and maintenance

## Risk Mitigation Updates

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Delta feed gaps | High | Story 1.2.5 validation | üîç Pending |
| Memory overflow | High | Streaming architecture | üîç To validate |
| Decimal precision | Medium | Int64 fallback ready | üîç To test |
| Schema changes | Medium | Version detection | üìã To design |

## New Architectural Approach: Validation-First

### Phase 1: Empirical Foundation (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Fix LiveCapture (Story 1.2)
```python
# Correct implementation - NO transformation
async def handle_message(msg, receive_ns):
    output = {
        "capture_ns": receive_ns,
        "stream": msg["stream"], 
        "data": msg["data"]  # Raw preservation
    }
    await writer.write_line(json.dumps(output))

# Correct WebSocket URL
ws_url = f"wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream?streams={symbol}@trade/{symbol}@depth@100ms"
```

#### 1.2 Build ValidationFramework
- Statistical test implementations (K-S, Anderson-Darling)
- Research claim validators
- Automated comparison tools
- Continuous validation pipeline

#### 1.3 Empirical Testing
- Test each AI research assumption
- Measure actual system characteristics
- Document findings in decision records

### Phase 2: Adaptive Implementation (After Validation)

Based on empirical findings, choose:

1. **If origin_time 100% reliable**: Simple timestamp merging
2. **If snapshots have gaps**: Snapshot-anchored approach
3. **If delta feed complete**: Full event reconstruction
4. **If memory constrained**: Streaming with windows

### Phase 3: Continuous Validation

- Every component validated against golden samples
- Automated regression testing
- Performance benchmarks tracked
- Fidelity metrics monitored

## Epic 1 Architecture Guidance - Revised

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Fix Story 1.2**: Correct WebSocket URL, preserve raw format, move to scripts/
2. **Re-run Story 1.1**: Use real Crypto Lake data
3. **Capture Golden Sample**: 24-hour raw data capture

### Validation Framework (Week 2)
1. **Build Core Validators**: K-S tests, microstructure analyzers
2. **Research Claim Testing**: Validate each assumption empirically
3. **Automated Reporting**: Fidelity score generation

### Decision Points (Week 3)
1. **Delta Feed Viability**: Can we use book_delta_v2?
2. **Memory Feasibility**: Can we process 8M events in 28GB?
3. **Reconstruction Approach**: Snapshot vs full replay?

## Next Architecture Updates

Based on Epic 1 results, architecture will need:

1. **Performance Baselines**: Document actual vs. theoretical
2. **Memory Patterns**: Streaming window sizing
3. **Error Recovery**: Patterns from production usage
4. **Operational Procedures**: Based on real data experience

## Architecture Documentation Standards

2. **Component Specs**: Detailed design per component
3. **Implementation Guides**: Story-specific guidance
4. **Decision Records**: Immutable architecture decisions

### Update Protocol
