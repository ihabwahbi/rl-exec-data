# Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap has been critically revised to address the fundamental execution gap where validation work was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake data remained unacquired. The roadmap now prioritizes **data acquisition as the absolute blocking prerequisite** before any validation or development work can begin.

2. **This Week - Urgent**
   - Establish data access
   - Begin sample download
   - Set up staging infrastructure

3. **Next Week - Important**
   - Complete initial validation
   - Start full download
   - Plan analysis phase

## Communication Plan

### Daily During Phase 0
- Data acquisition progress

## Critical Success Factors

1. **No Synthetic Data**: All validation uses actual Crypto Lake data
2. **Data First**: No development without confirmed data access
3. **Reality Check**: All assumptions validated with real data
4. **Fidelity Focus**: Every decision optimizes for statistical fidelity
5. **Continuous Validation**: Quality checks at every stage

**Remember**: Without actual data, all other work is meaningless. The multi-week data acquisition phase protects against months of wasted effort on invalid assumptions. Stay focused on getting real data first.
