# Architecture Updates Status

## Context
Based on technical review feedback received on 2025-07-18, the following architecture updates were required to support full market microstructure capture via delta feeds.

## Update Status ✅ COMPLETED - 2025-07-18

### 1. Data Models (data-models.md) ✅ COMPLETED
- Add new event type: `BOOK_DELTA` with fields:
  - `side`: 'BID' | 'ASK'
  - `price`: decimal128(38,18)
  - `new_quantity`: decimal128(38,18)
  - `update_id`: int64
  - `is_snapshot`: boolean (to mark full snapshots as anchors)
- Update all price/quantity fields from float64 to decimal128(38,18) for Parquet storage
- Add note about float32 conversion only at ML input layer

### 2. Components (components.md) ✅ COMPLETED
- **DataAssessor**: Add analysis of `book_delta_v2` table availability and completeness
- **Reconstructor**: 
  - Add `FullEventReplayStrategy` as primary strategy (using book_delta_v2)
  - Update to handle monotonic update_id ordering
  - Add sequence gap detection and recovery logic
  - Implement write-ahead log (WAL) for crash recovery
- **LiveCapture**: Add recording of both Binance E/T timestamps and local arrival time
- **FidelityReporter**: 
  - Add microstructure validation metrics
  - Add latency histogram analysis
  - Add per-level order book correlation metrics

### 3. High-Level Architecture (high-level-architecture.md) ✅ COMPLETED
- Update data flow to show delta feed as preferred path
- Add memory model constraints (level-bounded dicts for top 20 levels)
- Add streaming/chunking layer for large datasets

### 4. Infrastructure (infrastructure-and-deployment.md) ✅ COMPLETED
- Add observability metrics:
  - Sequence gaps filled per hour
  - Max mid-price deviation between vendor and rebuilt book
  - Peak heap memory usage
- Add security requirements for API key handling and encryption

### 5. Error Handling (error-handling-strategy.md) ✅ COMPLETED
- Add handling for sequence gaps in delta feeds
- Add clock skew detection and compensation
- Add memory pressure handling with graceful degradation

## Implementation Priority
1. Data model updates (blocking for Story 1.2.5)
2. Reconstructor strategy updates (needed for Epic 2)
3. Security and observability (can be incremental)

## Notes
These updates maintain backward compatibility with the snapshot-based approach while adding the preferred delta-based reconstruction path. The Strategy Pattern in Reconstructor allows runtime selection based on data availability.

## Completion Summary

All architecture updates have been successfully implemented:

✅ **Data Models**: Added BOOK_DELTA event type, decimal128 precision, book_delta_v2 schema
✅ **Components**: Enhanced all four components with delta feed support and microstructure validation
✅ **High-Level Architecture**: Updated diagrams, added memory model, documented three strategies  
✅ **Infrastructure**: Added observability metrics, security requirements, monitoring
✅ **Error Handling**: Added delta-specific error cases, sequence gap recovery, memory pressure handling

The architecture now fully supports complete market microstructure capture while maintaining backward compatibility and operating within hardware constraints. See `changelog.md` for detailed change documentation.
