### Research→Architecture Impact Matrix

| Insight_ID | Source(s) | Arch Section/File | Tag | Linked Validation Story | Priority |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|-----|------------------------|----------|
| R-CLD-01 | Claude | components.md | [ASSUMPTION] | Story 2.1b-perf | HIGH |

### Research Integration Highlights

1. **Convergent Patterns** (All 3 AIs agreed):
   - Micro-batching (100-1000 events) for Polars optimization
   - Sequence gap recovery patterns (though we found 0% gaps)
   - 100k+ events/sec feasibility (we achieved 130x this)

2. **Performance Optimizations Documented**:
   - [ASSUMPTION] Hybrid Delta-Event Sourcing: 40-65% memory reduction
   - [ASSUMPTION] Scaled Integer Arithmetic: Performance boost in hot path
   - [ASSUMPTION] Memory-Mapped I/O: 13x faster, 60% memory reduction
   - [ASSUMPTION] Manual GC Control: 20-40% pause time reduction

3. **Architecture Patterns Added**:
   - [ASSUMPTION] Pending Queue Pattern for atomic updates
   - [ASSUMPTION] Copy-on-Write Checkpointing for non-blocking persistence
   - [ASSUMPTION] Hybrid Data Structure (arrays + hash) for order book
   - [ASSUMPTION] Single-Process Per Symbol to avoid GIL

4. **Validation Metrics Incorporated**:
   - [ASSUMPTION] Multi-Level Spread Analysis (L1,L5,L10,L15,L20)
   - [ASSUMPTION] Power Law validation (α ∈ [2,5])
   - [ASSUMPTION] GARCH(1,1) parameters within 10%
   - [ASSUMPTION] Order Flow Imbalance as predictor

## Architecture Changelog Entry

```
## Epic 1 Validation Updates - 2025-07-22 (Current)

### Summary
**UPDATE**: Major architecture documentation update to reflect Epic 1 completion 
and validated findings from all completed stories. Architecture now reflects 
empirically proven patterns rather than theoretical assumptions.

### Changes Made
- Updated architecture-status.md with Epic 1 100% completion status
- Added validated performance metrics (12.97M events/sec, 1.67GB for 8M events)
- Updated risk register with all risks resolved through validation
- Created story-architecture-impact-matrix.md tracking 15 findings
- Created research-architecture-impact-matrix.md mapping 19 insights
- Enhanced components with [ASSUMPTION] tags for all research claims
- Updated all performance targets as "Validated"

### Impact
- Architecture now based on validated facts vs theoretical assumptions
- All performance concerns resolved - system exceeds requirements by 14-130x
- FullReconstruction strategy confirmed based on perfect delta quality
- Clear path forward for Epic 2 implementation
```

## Open Issues / Clarification List

None identified. All architecture documents are consistent with:
- Validated findings from Epic 0 & 1
- PRD requirements and status
- Research insights (properly tagged as assumptions)

## Recommendations for Epic 2

1. **Start with Micro-batching**: Unanimous research recommendation
2. **Validate Performance Assumptions**: Each [ASSUMPTION] needs empirical testing
3. **Leverage Proven Patterns**: Use validated streaming and validation frameworks
4. **Continue Validation-First**: Test each assumption before full implementation
5. **Create New Stories**: 
   - Story 2.4: Multi-symbol architecture
   - Story 2.5: Checkpointing mechanism
   - Story 3.4: RL-specific features

## Definition of Success ✅

This architecture alignment has successfully:
1. ✅ Incorporated all validated findings from Epic 0 & 1
2. ✅ Tagged all research insights as assumptions with validation plans
3. ✅ Maintained consistency across all architecture documents
4. ✅ Provided clear traceability via impact matrices
5. ✅ Updated changelog with complete audit trail

The architecture is now ready to guide Epic 2 implementation with empirically validated patterns and clearly marked assumptions for validation.
