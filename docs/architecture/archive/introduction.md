# Introduction

This document outlines the technical architecture for the RLX Co-Pilot Data Pipeline. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive blueprint for the engineering team and AI developer agents, detailing the system's components, data flows, standards, and implementation strategy. The architecture is designed directly from the requirements specified in the PRD, with a primary focus on achieving data fidelity, modularity, and determinism.

This architecture is designed to be flexible, explicitly accounting for the two potential data reconstruction strategies ("full event replay" vs. "snapshot-anchored") that depend on the outcome of the initial data analysis defined in Epic 1 of the PRD.
