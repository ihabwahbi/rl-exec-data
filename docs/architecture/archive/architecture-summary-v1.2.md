# Architecture Summary v1.2

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive architectural updates made in response to expert review feedback. Version 1.2 addresses critical gaps in microstructure capture, decimal precision, and streaming performance while maintaining pragmatic simplicity.

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Delta Feed Priority

**Decision**: Use `book_delta_v2` as primary data source, falling back to snapshots only when deltas unavailable.

**Rationale**: 
- Snapshots drop 111-4,995 events between 100ms windows
- Complete microstructure essential for -5bp VWAP target
- Delta feeds capture every order book change

**Implementation**:
- `FullEventReplayStrategy` as primary reconstruction strategy
- Sequence gap detection and recovery
- Memory-bounded order book with top 20 levels

### 2. Streaming Architecture

**Decision**: Process data in streaming fashion with bounded queues and backpressure.

**Rationale**:
- 220GB/month cannot fit in 28GB RAM
- Must sustain 100k events/second
- Crash recovery without full data reload

**Implementation**:
- 5-stage pipeline with asyncio queues
- Memory monitor with spill-to-disk
- Checkpoint every 5 minutes or 1M events
- See: [streaming-architecture.md](./streaming-architecture.md)

### 3. Decimal Precision Strategy

**Decision**: Use int64 pips (price × 10^8) as primary approach, with decimal128 as fallback.

**Rationale**:
- Polars decimal128 is experimental and may panic
- Int64 operations are 5-10x faster
- Pips pattern proven by major exchanges

**Implementation**:
- Symbol-specific pip multipliers
- Lossless round-trip conversion
- PyArrow decimal128 if needed
- See: [decimal-strategy.md](./decimal-strategy.md)

### 4. Simplified WAL

**Decision**: Replace RocksDB with append-only Parquet segments.

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates C++ dependency
- Simpler deployment and debugging
- Native Parquet tooling support

**Implementation**:
- 100MB Parquet segments
- Atomic rename for consistency
- Keep last 3 checkpoints

## Architecture Components (Updated)

### DataAssessor
- **New**: Analyzes `book_delta_v2` availability
- **New**: Sequence gap statistics
- **New**: Memory requirement estimation
- Strategy recommendation based on data quality

### LiveCapture  
- **New**: Records Binance E/T timestamps + local arrival
- **New**: Encryption at rest for API compliance
- **New**: NTP clock sync monitoring
- **New**: Automatic file rotation

### Reconstructor
- **New**: `FullEventReplayStrategy` using deltas
- **New**: Streaming mode with bounded queues
- **New**: Memory-efficient order book (top 20 levels)
- **New**: Write-ahead log for crash recovery

### FidelityReporter
- **New**: Microstructure validation metrics
- **New**: Sequence gap analysis
- **New**: Best bid/ask RMS error
- **New**: Per-level depth correlation

## Performance Requirements

### Validated Before Epic 2
- Throughput: ≥100,000 events/second sustained
- Memory: <24GB peak usage (28GB available)
- Latency: P95 <100ms for live capture
- Data Loss: <0.1% sequence gaps

### Optimization Techniques
- Zero-copy with Arrow arrays
- Numba JIT for hot paths
- Memory pool allocation
- Async I/O pipeline
- See: [performance-optimization.md](./performance-optimization.md)

## Error Handling Updates

### Streaming-Specific Failures
- **Backpressure**: Throttle → Pause → Emergency flush
- **Memory Pressure**: Reduce batch → Drop cache → Spill to disk
- **Sequence Gaps**: Small → Recovery from snapshot → Mark corrupt
- **Pipeline Stalls**: Detection and automatic restart
- See: [error-handling-streaming.md](./error-handling-streaming.md)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Validation (Week 1-2) - CRITICAL
- Delta feed viability on Beelink hardware
- Decimal128 vs int64 pips performance
- Go/No-Go decision gate

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (Week 3-6)
- Streaming infrastructure
- Order book engine
- Data models and conversion

### Phase 3: Production (Week 7-8)
- Observability and monitoring
- Historical backfill execution

### Phase 4: ML Integration (Week 9-10)
- Feature engineering
- RL environment interface

See: [implementation-roadmap.md](./implementation-roadmap.md)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Delta Feed Gaps**: Validate <0.1% before proceeding
2. **Decimal128 Maturity**: Int64 pips ready as fallback
3. **Memory Constraints**: Streaming + spill-to-disk
4. **Performance**: Multiple optimization paths documented

### Architectural Flexibility
- Strategy pattern allows easy pivoting
- Modular pipeline enables component swapping
- Clear interfaces for future enhancements

## Key Metrics for Success

### Data Quality
- Sequence gap ratio <0.1%
- Origin time coverage >99%
- Microstructure fidelity validated

### Performance  
- 100k+ events/second sustained
- <24GB memory usage
- 12-month backfill in <2 weeks

### Business Impact
- RL agent achieves -5bp VWAP improvement
- Deterministic replay for debugging
- Production-ready observability

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Execute validation spike (Story 1.2.5)
2. **Week 1**: Validate all technical assumptions
3. **Week 2**: Make Go/No-Go decision
4. **If Go**: Proceed with streaming implementation
5. **If No-Go**: Pivot architecture based on findings

## Conclusion

Architecture v1.2 addresses all critical feedback while maintaining implementation pragmatism. The validation-first approach ensures we build on solid technical foundations. The streaming architecture with bounded memory, decimal precision strategy, and comprehensive error handling create a robust pipeline capable of processing 220GB/month for RL training.

**Critical Success Factor**: The 2-week validation phase must be completed thoroughly. This investment prevents 2+ months of potential rework.
