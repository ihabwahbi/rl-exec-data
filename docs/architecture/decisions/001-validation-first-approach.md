# ADR-001: Validation-First Architecture Approach

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Story 1.2 implementation revealed fundamental misunderstandings between specification and implementation. The developer built a data transformation pipeline when raw data preservation was required. This indicates a deeper issue: we've been making architectural decisions based on assumptions from AI research rather than empirical evidence.

## Decision
We will adopt a validation-first approach where every architectural decision must be validated through empirical testing before implementation of complex features.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduces risk of building wrong features
- Catches specification misunderstandings early
- Provides confidence in architectural decisions
- Creates reusable validation infrastructure
- Enables data-driven decision making

### Negative
- Adds upfront time for validation framework
- Delays feature implementation
- Requires more infrastructure code
- May seem like "overhead" to developers

### Neutral
- Changes development workflow
- Requires cultural shift to empirical thinking
- Needs continuous validation practices

## Implementation
1. Build ValidationFramework as new core component
2. Require golden sample capture before any reconstruction
3. Gate each phase on validation results
4. Document all empirical findings

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Continue with current approach**: Risk building entire pipeline on wrong assumptions
2. **Limited validation**: Only validate critical paths - may miss important edge cases
3. **Post-implementation validation**: Too late to catch fundamental issues
