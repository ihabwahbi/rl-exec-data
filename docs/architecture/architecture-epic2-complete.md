# RLX Co-Pilot Data Pipeline Architecture - Post-Epic 2
**Status**: Epic 2 Complete, Epic 3 Architecture Planning Required  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-24  
**Performance**: 345K msg/s achieved (3.45x requirement)

## Executive Summary

Epic 2 has been successfully completed with exceptional engineering quality, achieving 345K messages/second throughput (3.45x the 100K requirement). However, the review reveals critical gaps:
- FidelityReporter component: 0% implemented (only validation framework exists)
- Multiple undocumented but implemented patterns (WAL, memory-mapped I/O, etc.)
- Missing Epic 3 architecture for comprehensive metrics implementation

    - Zero-copy operations
    - OS-level caching
    - Efficient large file handling
performance_impact: "20x improvement in I/O operations"
```

### 3. Pipeline State Provider Pattern
```yaml
pattern: Pipeline-State-Provider
purpose: Abstract state management interface

  - Metrics tracked:
    - Sequence gaps
    - Time drift
    - State divergence
  - Thresholds:
    - Max drift: 1000ms
    - Alert on: >0.1% gaps
```

## Multi-Symbol Architecture

### Process-per-Symbol Pattern
```yaml
architecture: Process-per-Symbol
rationale: Avoid Python GIL, ensure fault isolation
components:
  ProcessManager:
    role: Lifecycle management
    features:
      - Process spawning/monitoring
      - Health checks
      - Graceful shutdown
      - Resource allocation
  
  SymbolRouter:
    role: Message distribution
    features:
      - Symbol-based routing
      - Load balancing
      - Backpressure handling
      - Message buffering
  
  SymbolWorker:
    role: Isolated pipeline execution
    features:
      - Independent state
      - Crash isolation
      - Linear scaling
      - Memory bounded

benefits:
  - GIL avoidance: True parallelism
  - Fault isolation: Symbol crash doesn't affect others
  - Linear scaling: Add workers for more symbols
  - Resource control: Per-symbol memory limits
```

  - MetricPlugin interface defined and tested
  - MetricRegistry with plugin discovery
  - Basic report generation (text/markdown)
  - Integration points with pipeline
estimate: "5-8 days"
```

### Story 3.1a: Core Microstructure Metrics

  - Order Flow Imbalance (OFI)
  - Kyle's Lambda
  - Trade arrival rates

  - Power law tail validation
  - GARCH(1,1) volatility clustering
  - Jump detection algorithms
  - Return autocorrelation
estimate: "10-12 days"

```yaml
fidelity_reporter_missing:
  risk: "Core component completely missing"
  impact: "Cannot validate reconstruction quality"
  mitigation: "Prioritize Story 3.0 immediately"
  
complex_metrics:
  risk: "GARCH, power law require expertise"
  impact: "May need external libraries/consultation"
  mitigation: "Research existing implementations"
```

### Medium Risk Items
```yaml
performance_impact:
  risk: "Metrics may slow reconstruction"
  impact: "Throughput reduction"
  mitigation: "Hybrid streaming/batch approach"
  
memory_requirements:
  risk: "Metrics need historical context"
  impact: "Increased memory usage"
  mitigation: "Sliding window implementations"
```

## Success Metrics

### Epic 3 Success Criteria
1. **FidelityReporter Operational**: Full component with plugin architecture
2. **Metric Coverage**: 100% of PRD metrics implemented
3. **Performance Maintained**: <10% impact on reconstruction throughput
4. **Automated Reporting**: Charts, dashboards, and validation reports
5. **Research Validated**: All assumptions measured and documented

## Conclusion

Epic 2's implementation is exceptional, achieving 3.45x the required performance. However, significant work remains for Epic 3:
- FidelityReporter must be built from scratch
- 60% of metrics need implementation
- Visual reporting infrastructure required
- Research validation framework needed

The architecture is solid and extensible, but Epic 3 should be estimated at 2x the original scope given the missing components.
