## Version 1.4 - 2025-07-19

### Summary
**Critical architectural revision** to address fundamental execution gap where validation was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake historical data was never acquired. This version implements a "data-first" architecture with Epic 0 as an absolute blocking prerequisite.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Data Acquisition as Blocking Gate
- **Created** `data-acquisition-architecture.md` defining Epic 0 as mandatory first phase
- **Added** DataAcquisitionManager, CryptoLakeAPIClient, DataDownloader, IntegrityValidator components
- **Implemented** staging area pattern with raw/validating/ready/quarantine zones
- **Enforced** hard block preventing any work without data readiness certificate

#### 2. Architecture Realignment
- **Updated** high-level architecture to show Epic 0 blocking gate in all diagrams
- **Enhanced** components.md with research-aligned implementations:
  - LiveCapture: Market regime detection, multi-session management
  - Reconstructor: Full Chronological Event Replay algorithm implementation
  - FidelityReporter: Complete metrics catalogue from research document
- **Revised** implementation roadmap with Phase 0 (3 weeks) for data acquisition

#### 3. Paradigm Bridge Enhancements
- **Documented** explicit handling of snapshot-based vs differential stream paradigm gap
- **Implemented** stable sort requirements for chronological ordering
- **Added** stateful order book reconstruction with drift tracking
- **Enhanced** validation to cover multiple market regimes (high/low volume, special events)

#### 4. Research Alignment
- **Incorporated** all findings from gemini-datapipeline-research.md:
  - Chronological Event Replay 4-step algorithm
  - Complete fidelity metrics catalogue (K-S tests, microstructure analysis)
  - Market regime awareness requirements
  - Origin_time as universal clock approach
- **Added** explicit handling of book drift and resynchronization

### Rationale
The project was at risk of months of wasted effort validating against synthetic data that doesn't represent actual market behavior. By making data acquisition the blocking gate, we ensure all subsequent work is grounded in reality. The research document provided sophisticated approaches to bridge the paradigm gap between data formats, which are now fully incorporated.

### Impact
- **Timeline**: Extended to 14-20 weeks (from 10-12) due to data acquisition phase
- **Risk**: Dramatically reduced - no longer building on synthetic assumptions
- **Quality**: Ensures all validation uses actual market data
- **Fidelity**: Implements comprehensive statistical validation from research

### Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Verify Crypto Lake API access and credentials
2. **Week 1**: Begin data acquisition process
3. **Week 2-3**: Download and validate 12 months of historical data
4. **Week 4+**: Only after data ready, begin Epic 1 analysis

## Version 1.2 - 2025-07-18 (Evening Update)

### Summary
Risk mitigation updates based on expert review feedback. Focus on implementation simplification and validation requirements.

### Key Changes

#### Component Simplifications
- **Reconstructor WAL**: Replaced RocksDB with simple append-only Parquet segments (eliminates C++ dependency)
- **Bounded Queue Pattern**: Added `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=2000)` specification for backpressure
- **Decimal Fallback**: Documented int64 pips strategy if Polars decimal128 fails

#### Implementation Guidance
- **LiveCapture**: Added NTP monitoring, file rotation, and secure memory wiping
- **Data Models**: Added tensor adapter pattern for safe decimal→float32 conversion
- **Performance Requirements**: Must validate ≥100k events/sec before Epic 2

#### New Documentation
- Created `TECHNICAL_VALIDATION_PLAN.md` with specific Go/No-Go criteria
- Defined concrete validation tasks and risk mitigation strategies

### Rationale
These changes address practical implementation concerns while maintaining architectural integrity. The simplifications reduce deployment complexity without sacrificing functionality.

## Version 1.1 - 2025-07-18

### Summary
Major architectural update to support full market microstructure capture via delta feeds, addressing critical gaps identified in technical review. These changes ensure the pipeline captures all market events (preventing loss of 111-4,995 events between snapshots) while maintaining memory efficiency and data precision.

### Key Architectural Changes

#### 1. Data Models Enhancement
- **Added** `book_delta_v2` input schema for differential order book updates
- **Added** `BOOK_DELTA` event type to unified schema
- **Changed** all price/quantity fields from float64 to decimal128(38,18) for precise storage
- **Added** memory optimization strategy (bounded dictionaries for top 20 levels)

#### 2. Component Upgrades

**DataAssessor:**
- Now analyzes `book_delta_v2` availability and completeness
- Performs sequence gap analysis
- Estimates memory requirements for delta processing

**LiveCapture:**
- Records both Binance E/T timestamps and local arrival time
- Implements data encryption at rest
- Minimum 24-hour capture requirement

**Reconstructor:**
- **Added** `FullEventReplayStrategy` as primary strategy using book_delta_v2
- Implements monotonic update_id ordering
- Write-ahead log (WAL) for crash recovery
- Streaming mode for memory-constrained processing
- Order book engine with bounded memory model

**FidelityReporter:**
- Added microstructure validation metrics
- Sequence gap analysis
- Best bid/ask RMS error calculation
- Per-level depth correlation
- Latency histogram analysis

#### 3. High-Level Architecture
- Updated data flow to show three input sources (trades, snapshots, deltas)
- Added WAL component for crash recovery
- Documented memory-bounded processing patterns
- Enhanced Strategy Pattern with three concrete strategies

#### 4. Error Handling
- Added sequence gap detection and recovery
- Clock skew compensation logic
- Memory pressure handling with graceful degradation
- WAL recovery procedures

#### 5. Infrastructure & Security
- Added comprehensive observability metrics
- OpenTelemetry format for metrics export
- Security requirements for API key handling
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Access control and audit trails

### Technical Rationale

**Delta Feed Priority:** Snapshot-only reconstruction was dropping hundreds of market events between 100ms windows. Delta feeds capture every order book change, essential for training RL agents on realistic market microstructure.

**Decimal Precision:** Float rounding was causing precision loss on small-quantity symbols (e.g., SOL-USDT). Decimal128 storage preserves exact values throughout the pipeline.

**Memory Model:** Processing 1 hour of BTC-USDT deltas (~8M events) must fit in 28GB RAM. Bounded dictionaries and streaming mode ensure scalability.

**Security & Observability:** Production deployment requires proper credential handling and monitoring to maintain data integrity and detect issues early.

### Migration Notes

These changes maintain backward compatibility - the snapshot-based strategies remain available as fallbacks. Existing Story 1.1 implementation requires no changes. New stories should prioritize delta feed analysis and implementation.

### Next Steps

1. Story 1.2.5 should validate delta feed viability on actual hardware
2. Epic 2 implementation should start with FullEventReplayStrategy
3. Monitor sequence gap patterns to refine recovery strategies
