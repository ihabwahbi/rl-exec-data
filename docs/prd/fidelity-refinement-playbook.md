# Fidelity Refinement Playbook

## Executive Summary

This playbook defines the **Integrated Fidelity Refinement (IFR) Workflow** for Epic 3, a specialized agile process designed to systematically drive the Reconstructor's output to achieve 100% pass rate against all FidelityReporter metrics. The workflow integrates continuous validation principles from MLOps Level 2 with proven agile methodologies to create a rapid, data-driven refinement cycle.

**Core Principle**: Treat FidelityReporter metrics as evolving acceptance tests that drive iterative improvements in the Reconstructor until all fidelity criteria are met.

## Integrated Fidelity Refinement (IFR) Workflow

### Sprint Structure

**Model**: Integrated Refinement Sprints (2-week cycles)

Each sprint contains a carefully prioritized mix of:
- **Metric Implementation Stories**: New validation tests added to FidelityReporter
- **Fidelity Defect Stories**: Fixes to Reconstructor based on failing metrics

**Key Advantage**: Minimizes feedback latency - a new metric can be implemented, failure observed, issue triaged, and fix developed all within the same sprint.

**Sprint Goal Template**: 
> "By sprint end, we will implement [specific metrics] in the FidelityReporter and resolve all Critical/High severity defects related to [component], increasing our overall Fidelity Score by at least [X] points."

### Fidelity Value Score (FVS) - Prioritization Framework

The FVS provides a quantitative, unified scoring model for prioritizing all backlog items:

```
FVS = (Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

#### Component Definitions

**Impact (1-100)**:
- For Fidelity Defects: Based on severity
  - Critical (90-100): Complete failure, corrupted data, massive deviation in critical variables
  - Major (60-89): Significant statistical deviation in key features
  - Minor (1-59): Slight deviation in less critical features
- For Metric Implementation: Based on validation importance
  - Core validation (80-100): Fundamental data properties
  - Important validation (50-79): Key statistical properties  
  - Nice-to-have (1-49): Secondary properties

**Confidence (1-100)**:
- For Fidelity Defects: Convergence Factor - likelihood that fixing this defect will resolve multiple failing tests
- For Metric Implementation: Coverage Expansion - how much new validation surface area the metric covers

**Effort**: T-shirt sizes converted to points (XS=1, S=2, M=3, L=5, XL=8)

### Triage and Root Cause Analysis Process

#### Step 1: Automated Failure Logging
Every validation failure must be automatically logged with:
- Failing metric name and timestamp
- Unique data batch ID
- Specific values causing failure
- Link to validation report

#### Step 2: Initial Triage Meeting
Small triage team (Tech Lead, Senior Data Scientist, Senior Engineer) conducts time-boxed diagnosis to form hypothesis about error source.

#### Step 3: Structured Root Cause Analysis

**Five Whys Method**: For drilling into logic failures
```
Why did the Kurtosis test fail?
→ Because the generated distribution has excessively fat tails
→ Why does it have fat tails?
→ Because the volatility component over-reacts to outliers
→ Why is it over-reacting?
→ Because its dampening parameter is not constrained
```

**Fishbone Diagram Categories**:
1. **Reconstructor Flaw**: Bug or incorrect implementation
2. **FidelityReporter Flaw**: Error in validation logic
3. **Golden Sample Artifact**: Anomaly in benchmark data
4. **Pipeline/Environment Issue**: External factors

#### Step 4: Disposition and Work Item Creation
- Reconstructor Flaw → Create Fidelity Defect Story
- FidelityReporter Flaw → Create bug ticket for validation engine
- Golden Sample Artifact → Create data analysis task
- Pipeline Issue → Escalate to platform team

### Convergence Dashboard

The dashboard provides real-time visibility into Epic 3 progress:

#### Primary Visualization: Fidelity Score Burn-Up Chart
- **X-axis**: Time (days/sprints)
- **Y-axis**: Aggregate Fidelity Score
- **Line 1 (Total Scope)**: Sum of all metric values, steps up as new metrics are added
- **Line 2 (Achieved Fidelity)**: Sum of passing metric values, climbs as defects are fixed
- **Success**: Lines converge and stay together (100% pass rate)

#### Secondary Visualizations
- **Test Pass Rate Trend**: Percentage of passing tests over time
- **Defect Discovery vs Resolution**: Cumulative flow of created vs closed defects
- **Critical Metric Status**: Red/green dashboard of key validation metrics
- **Performance Indicators**: Throughput, latency, resource utilization

### Multi-Layered Definition of Done

#### Layer 1: Story-Level DoD
A story is "Done" when:
- Code is written, reviewed, and merged
- Unit/integration tests pass
- For Defects: Specific metric(s) now pass in pipeline run
- For Metrics: New metric integrated and documented

#### Layer 2: Sprint-Level DoD
A sprint is "Done" when:
- All committed stories meet Story-Level DoD
- Sprint Goal achieved
- Sprint Review conducted with progress demonstrated
- Feedback captured and logged

#### Layer 3: Epic-Level DoD (Final Goal)
Epic 3 is "Done" when:
1. **Metric Completeness**: 100% of planned metrics implemented
2. **Fidelity Convergence**: Sustained 100% pass rate over multiple consecutive runs (24-48 hours)
3. **Documentation**: All components and processes fully documented
4. **Performance**: <5% overhead when validation enabled

## Capacity Allocation Guidelines

### Recommended Sprint Allocation
- **30-40%**: Critical Fidelity Defects (Reactive)
- **50-60%**: Metric Implementation (Proactive)
- **10-20%**: Infrastructure and Technical Debt

### Dynamic Adjustment Rules
- If defect discovery rate > resolution rate for 2+ sprints → Increase defect allocation
- If all P0/P1 defects resolved → Increase metric implementation
- Maintain minimum 20% proactive work to prevent stagnation

## Success Metrics and KPIs

### Primary Metrics
- **Fidelity Score**: (Passed Checks + Warning Checks) / Total Checks × 100%
- **Table Uptime**: Percentage of time validation passes (target >95%)
- **Coverage Percentage**: Portion of data under active validation (target ~100%)
- **Mean Time to Resolution**: Average hours from failure to fix deployment

### Velocity Metrics
- **Defect Resolution Rate**: Defects closed per sprint
- **Metric Implementation Rate**: New metrics added per sprint
- **FVS Delivery**: Sum of FVS scores delivered per sprint

### Quality Metrics
- **First-Time Pass Rate**: Percentage of new metrics passing on first run
- **Regression Rate**: Percentage of fixes causing new failures
- **Triage Accuracy**: Percentage of correct root cause identifications

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Risks and Mitigations

**Risk**: Defect discovery outpaces resolution
- **Mitigation**: Implement WIP limits, focus on high-convergence fixes

**Risk**: False positives from overly strict metrics
- **Mitigation**: Calibrate thresholds using golden samples, implement warning levels

**Risk**: Team burnout from constant context switching
- **Mitigation**: Dedicate team members to either metrics or defects per sprint

**Risk**: Stakeholder impatience with iterative progress
- **Mitigation**: Clear dashboard communication, regular demonstrations of improvement

## Regulatory Alignment

This workflow ensures compliance with data quality requirements:

### MiFID II Compliance
- Full audit trail of all validation failures and resolutions
- Documented root cause analysis for each issue
- Systematic remediation process with defined SLAs
- Comprehensive testing before production deployment

### Best Practices Alignment
- Continuous validation (not just end-of-project testing)
- Data-driven prioritization (FVS scores)
- Rapid feedback loops (intra-sprint refinement)
- Transparent progress tracking (Convergence Dashboard)

## Conclusion

The Integrated Fidelity Refinement workflow transforms Epic 3 from a traditional QA phase into a systematic, data-driven convergence process. By combining agile ceremonies with quantitative prioritization (FVS), structured triage (RCA), and clear visualization (burn-up charts), the team can efficiently drive the Reconstructor to achieve the required fidelity standards while maintaining transparency and compliance throughout the journey.

Success is measured not just by the final 100% pass rate, but by the velocity of convergence, the accuracy of root cause analysis, and the reusability of the validation framework for future data products.
