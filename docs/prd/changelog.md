## Version 1.4 - 2025-07-19 (Research Alignment Update)

### Summary
**ENHANCEMENT**: Comprehensive PRD alignment with the research document "Data Fidelity & Synchronization Strategy" to ensure proper data profiling, golden sample capture, and fidelity maximization approach.

### Changes Made

#### Epic 1 Enhancements
- **Story 1.2**: Expanded live data capture requirements to include:
  - Multiple market regime samples (high volume, low volume, special events)
  - Proper order book initialization (REST snapshot + WebSocket sync)
  - Nanosecond timestamp precision
  - Chronological ordering validation
- **Story 1.3**: Transformed into comprehensive data profiling story:
  - Full fidelity metrics catalogue implementation
  - Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on all distributions
  - Market microstructure analysis
  - Gap identification between historical and live formats

#### Epic 2 Clarifications
- **Story 2.2**: Detailed Chronological Event Replay algorithm:
  - Stateful replayer architecture
  - Trade event application (liquidity consumption)
  - Snapshot validation and drift measurement
  - Resynchronization logic

#### Epic 3 Enhancements  
- **Story 3.1**: Expanded fidelity metrics to include:
  - Order flow dynamics metrics
  - Market state properties metrics
  - Price return characteristics
  - Visual comparison tools (histograms, Q-Q plots)

#### Goals & Background Updates
- **New Goal**: Bridge different data paradigms through sophisticated reconstruction
- **Background**: Added critical technical challenge section explaining the fundamental reconciliation needed between snapshot-based historical data and differential live feeds

### Rationale
The research document provides comprehensive methodology for achieving maximum data fidelity. These updates ensure the PRD fully captures the sophisticated approach needed to reconcile Crypto Lake's snapshot-based format with Binance's differential streaming format while maintaining statistical fidelity.

### Impact
- **Comprehensive Profiling**: Ensures thorough understanding of both data formats before reconstruction
- **Statistical Rigor**: Implements academic-grade validation methodology  
- **Multiple Validation Points**: Captures different market regimes for robust testing
- **Clear Reconstruction Path**: Defines exact algorithm for bridging data paradigms

## Version 1.3 - 2025-07-18 (Critical Execution Gap Fix)

### Summary
**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Comprehensive PRD revision to address the execution gap where validation work was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake data remained unacquired. This update prioritizes data acquisition as the absolute first step to prevent this gap from recurring.

### Changes Made

#### Data Acquisition Priority
- **NEW Story 1.0**: Added blocking data acquisition story with explicit milestones
- **All Epics**: Added prerequisites preventing work without actual data
- **Requirements**: Added FR0 as blocking prerequisite for all other work

#### Goals & Context
- **Primary Goal**: Elevated data acquisition to primary goal status
- **Background Context**: Added critical execution learning section
- **All Goals**: Updated to emphasize actual data over synthetic data

#### Requirements (All Updated)
- **FR0 (NEW)**: Data acquisition blocking prerequisite with success criteria
- **FR1-FR6**: All updated to require actual Crypto Lake data, not synthetic
- **NFR1**: Critical validation must use real data, not synthetic

#### Technical Assumptions
- **NEW Section**: Data assumptions emphasizing real data prerequisite
- **Risk Mitigation**: Added synthetic data fallback policies
- **Timeline**: Data acquisition identified as critical path

#### Epics (Completely Restructured)
- **Epic 1**: Renamed to "Data Acquisition & Foundational Analysis"
- **Epic 2**: Cannot begin until Epic 1 complete with actual data
- **Epic 3**: Requires actual historical data processing completion

#### Next Steps
- **Phase 0**: Added blocking data acquisition phase
- **Architect Prompt**: Updated to emphasize data acquisition gates

### Rationale
Project execution revealed a critical gap where all validation work was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake data remained unacquired. This created a false sense of progress and validation that would not translate to real data processing. This update ensures:

1. **Data Acquisition First**: No validation work can proceed without actual data
2. **Real Data Validation**: All testing must use actual market data patterns
3. **Execution Sequencing**: Clear gates prevent validation before data acquisition
4. **Timeline Reality**: Data acquisition acknowledged as critical path

### Impact
- **Prevents False Progress**: Ensures all validation reflects actual data challenges
- **Realistic Timeline**: Data acquisition timeline properly incorporated
- **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates synthetic-to-real data transition risk
- **Execution Clarity**: Clear sequencing prevents future execution gaps

## Version 1.2 - 2025-07-18 (Evening Update)

### Summary
Critical updates based on expert technical review to address execution risks before Epic 2 implementation. Focus on validation gates and performance requirements.

### Changes Made

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR6 (Throughput Performance)**: NEW - Added requirement for â‰¥100,000 events/second sustained throughput
- **NFR7 (Data Retention Policy)**: NEW - Added security requirements for golden sample data lifecycle

#### Functional Requirements  
- **FR3 (Live Data Capture)**: Expanded from single to 3 distinct 24-hour capture windows for market regime diversity

#### Epics
- **Story 1.2.5**: Significantly expanded scope to include:
  - Comprehensive delta feed validation
  - Memory and throughput profiling
  - Decimal128 pipeline proof-of-concept
  - Go/No-Go decision gate with specific criteria

### Rationale
Expert review identified two potential show-stoppers that could cause months of rework if not validated upfront:
1. Delta feed integrity and throughput capacity
2. Polars decimal128 toolchain maturity

These updates ensure we validate critical assumptions before committing to Epic 2 implementation.

## Version 1.1 - 2025-07-18

### Summary
Major update based on external technical review feedback to address critical gaps in market microstructure capture and data precision requirements.

### Changes Made

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR4 (Chronological Unification)**: Added preference for `book_delta_v2` delta feed as primary reconstruction method to capture full market microstructure
- **FR6 (Fidelity Reporting)**: 
  - Added minimum 24-hour golden sample requirement
  - Added microstructure parity metrics (sequence gaps, RMS error, depth correlation)
  - Added live capture latency requirement (95th percentile < 100ms)

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR3 (Performance)**: Added explicit 32GB RAM constraint and streaming requirement if deltas exceed memory
- **NFR5 (Security)**: NEW - Added requirements for API key handling, encryption at rest, and credential security

#### Goals
- Added explicit RL agent acceptance metric: VWAP slippage â‰¤ -5 basis points vs baseline on 30 unseen days

#### Epics
- **Epic 1**: Added Story 1.2.5 to analyze delta feed viability and validate memory constraints
- **Epic 2**: 
  - Added Story 2.1b for delta feed parser and order book engine implementation
  - Updated Story 2.3 to specify decimal128(38,18) precision for Parquet storage

### Rationale
These changes address critical findings that snapshot-only reconstruction drops hundreds of intra-window market events (mean 111, max 4,995 sequence gaps). Without delta feeds, the RL agent would train on incomplete market dynamics, creating unacceptable sim-to-real gap.

### Impact
- Ensures full market microstructure capture for realistic RL agent training
- Prevents precision loss on small-quantity symbols (e.g., SOL-USDT)
- Adds security guardrails for production deployment
- Provides clear success metrics tied to business objectives
