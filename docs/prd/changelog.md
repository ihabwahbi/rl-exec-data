---

## Version 1.3 - 2025-07-18 (Critical Execution Gap Fix)

### Summary
**CRITICAL UPDATE**: Comprehensive PRD revision to address the execution gap where validation work was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake data remained unacquired. This update prioritizes data acquisition as the absolute first step to prevent this gap from recurring.

### Changes Made

#### Data Acquisition Priority
- **NEW Story 1.0**: Added blocking data acquisition story with explicit milestones
- **All Epics**: Added prerequisites preventing work without actual data
- **Requirements**: Added FR0 as blocking prerequisite for all other work

#### Goals & Context
- **Primary Goal**: Elevated data acquisition to primary goal status
- **Background Context**: Added critical execution learning section
- **All Goals**: Updated to emphasize actual data over synthetic data

#### Requirements (All Updated)
- **FR0 (NEW)**: Data acquisition blocking prerequisite with success criteria
- **FR1-FR6**: All updated to require actual Crypto Lake data, not synthetic
- **NFR1**: Critical validation must use real data, not synthetic

#### Technical Assumptions
- **NEW Section**: Data assumptions emphasizing real data prerequisite
- **Risk Mitigation**: Added synthetic data fallback policies
- **Timeline**: Data acquisition identified as critical path

#### Epics (Completely Restructured)
- **Epic 1**: Renamed to "Data Acquisition & Foundational Analysis"
- **Epic 2**: Cannot begin until Epic 1 complete with actual data
- **Epic 3**: Requires actual historical data processing completion

#### Next Steps
- **Phase 0**: Added blocking data acquisition phase
- **Architect Prompt**: Updated to emphasize data acquisition gates

### Rationale
Project execution revealed a critical gap where all validation work was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake data remained unacquired. This created a false sense of progress and validation that would not translate to real data processing. This update ensures:

1. **Data Acquisition First**: No validation work can proceed without actual data
2. **Real Data Validation**: All testing must use actual market data patterns
3. **Execution Sequencing**: Clear gates prevent validation before data acquisition
4. **Timeline Reality**: Data acquisition acknowledged as critical path

### Impact
- **Prevents False Progress**: Ensures all validation reflects actual data challenges
- **Realistic Timeline**: Data acquisition timeline properly incorporated
- **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates synthetic-to-real data transition risk
- **Execution Clarity**: Clear sequencing prevents future execution gaps

  - Decimal128 pipeline proof-of-concept
  - Go/No-Go decision gate with specific criteria

### Rationale
Expert review identified two potential show-stoppers that could cause months of rework if not validated upfront:
1. Delta feed integrity and throughput capacity
2. Polars decimal128 toolchain maturity

These updates ensure we validate critical assumptions before committing to Epic 2 implementation.

---

## Version 1.1 - 2025-07-18

### Summary
Major update based on external technical review feedback to address critical gaps in market microstructure capture and data precision requirements.

### Changes Made

#### Functional Requirements
- **FR4 (Chronological Unification)**: Added preference for `book_delta_v2` delta feed as primary reconstruction method to capture full market microstructure
- **FR6 (Fidelity Reporting)**: 
  - Added minimum 24-hour golden sample requirement
  - Added microstructure parity metrics (sequence gaps, RMS error, depth correlation)
  - Added live capture latency requirement (95th percentile < 100ms)

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR3 (Performance)**: Added explicit 32GB RAM constraint and streaming requirement if deltas exceed memory
- **NFR5 (Security)**: NEW - Added requirements for API key handling, encryption at rest, and credential security

#### Goals
- Added explicit RL agent acceptance metric: VWAP slippage ≤ -5 basis points vs baseline on 30 unseen days

#### Epics
- **Epic 1**: Added Story 1.2.5 to analyze delta feed viability and validate memory constraints
- **Epic 2**: 
  - Added Story 2.1b for delta feed parser and order book engine implementation
  - Updated Story 2.3 to specify decimal128(38,18) precision for Parquet storage

### Rationale
These changes address critical findings that snapshot-only reconstruction drops hundreds of intra-window market events (mean 111, max 4,995 sequence gaps). Without delta feeds, the RL agent would train on incomplete market dynamics, creating unacceptable sim-to-real gap.

### Impact
- Ensures full market microstructure capture for realistic RL agent training
- Prevents precision loss on small-quantity symbols (e.g., SOL-USDT)
- Adds security guardrails for production deployment
- Provides clear success metrics tied to business objectives
