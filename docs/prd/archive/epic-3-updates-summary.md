# EPIC 3 PRD Updates Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-24  
**Context**: Epic 2 review revealed critical gaps requiring PRD updates before Epic 3

## Updates Completed

### 1. Requirements Documentation (requirements.md)
- ✅ **FR6 Status Update**: Marked as "Partially Complete - Foundation Only" with EPIC 3 dependency
- ✅ **NFR7 Status Update**: Marked as "Not Implemented" with action required
- ✅ **Added Missing Features Section**: Documented WAL, Memory-Mapped Processing, Drift Tracking, Pipeline State Provider
- ✅ **Performance Update**: Updated NFR6 to show achieved 345K msg/s (3.45x requirement)
- ✅ **Research Verification Section**: Added status for all research assumptions (3 verified, 4 not verified)

### 2. Project Status (project-status.md)
- ✅ **Epic 3 Section Update**: Added critical finding about FidelityReporter 0% implementation
- ✅ **New Stories Listed**: Added all 7 stories (3.0, 3.1a, 3.1b, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5)
- ✅ **Risk Register Update**: Added "FidelityReporter missing" as new high-impact risk

### 3. Epic Documentation (epics.md)
- ✅ **Epic 3 Restructured**: Added "CRITICAL UPDATE" section
- ✅ **Story 3.0 Added**: FidelityReporter Foundation (5 days, blocking)
- ✅ **Story 3.1 Split**: Into 3.1a Core Microstructure (3 days) and 3.1b Statistical (4 days)
- ✅ **Story 3.5 Added**: Research Validation Suite (3 days)
- ✅ **Timeline Update**: Epic 3 now 20-25 days vs original 10-15 days

### 4. New Story Documents Created
- ✅ **3.0.fidelityreporter-foundation.md**: Complete story with architecture, acceptance criteria, implementation plan
- ✅ **3.1a.core-microstructure-metrics.md**: Spread analysis, OFI, Kyle's Lambda, basic distributions
- ✅ **3.1b.statistical-distribution-metrics.md**: Power law, GARCH, jump detection, statistical tests
- ✅ **3.5.research-validation-suite.md**: Framework to validate all research claims

### 5. Next Steps (next-steps.md)
- ✅ **Complete Rewrite**: Focused on Epic 3 preparation instead of Epic 2
- ✅ **Critical Findings Section**: Highlighted FidelityReporter gap
- ✅ **Architecture Requirements**: Added FidelityReporter design needs
- ✅ **Implementation Plan**: Updated for 4-week Epic 3 timeline
- ✅ **Research Status**: Added verification status for all assumptions

## Key Findings Documented

### Missing Components
1. **FidelityReporter**: 0% implemented (only validation framework exists)
2. **Metric Catalogue**: 40% implemented (only basic validators)
3. **Visual Reporting**: 0% implemented
4. **Research Validation**: 0% implemented

### Research Assumptions Status
**Verified (3):**
- [R-GMN-01] Scaled Integer Arithmetic ✅
- [R-OAI-01] Pending Queue Pattern ✅
- [R-ALL-01] Micro-batching ✅

**Not Verified (4):**
- [R-CLD-01] Hybrid Delta-Event Sourcing ❌
- [R-CLD-03] Multi-Level Spread Analysis ❌
- [R-GMN-03] Power Law Tail Validation ❌
- [R-OAI-02] GARCH Volatility Clustering ❌

### Timeline Impact
- **Original Epic 3 Estimate**: 10-15 days
- **Revised Epic 3 Estimate**: 20-25 days (2x increase)
- **Critical Path**: Story 3.0 → 3.1a/b → 3.2/3.3 → 3.4
- **Parallel Work**: Story 3.5 can run alongside after 3.1a/b

## Recommendations for PM

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review and approve new story structure
   - Re-estimate Epic 3 with team (recommend 2x original)
   - Define visual reporting requirements in detail
   - Prioritize metrics by RL training importance

2. **During Epic 3 Planning**:
   - Consider external libraries for complex metrics (powerlaw, arch)
   - Plan iterative delivery (core metrics first)
   - Build comprehensive test suite for metrics
   - Define clear acceptance criteria for each metric

3. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Start Story 3.0 immediately as it blocks everything
   - Consider parallel teams for 3.1a and 3.1b
   - Early spike on complex metrics (GARCH, jump detection)
   - Regular validation against golden samples

## Summary

All PRD documentation has been updated to reflect the reality discovered during Epic 2 review. The missing FidelityReporter component represents significant work that wasn't apparent in original planning. Epic 3 has been properly scoped with new stories to address all gaps. The implementation quality of Epic 2 is exceptional, but documentation and planning needed these updates to properly scope Epic 3.
