# Initial Research Summary

This document consolidates the initial research conducted across multiple AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) to inform the RLX Data Pipeline design.

## Research Methodology

We consulted three leading AI models to gather diverse perspectives on building a high-fidelity market data reconstruction pipeline. Each model provided unique insights that shaped our approach.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Data Reconstruction Approaches

**Consensus Finding**: All models agreed that a chronological event replay approach with stateful order book maintenance provides the highest fidelity reconstruction.

**Key Insights**:
- Trade events must be applied to order book state to capture liquidity consumption
- Periodic snapshots serve as checkpoints for drift correction
- Delta feeds (if available) can provide even higher fidelity

### 2. Decimal Precision Requirements

**Critical Finding**: Financial calculations require decimal128(38,18) precision to avoid cumulative rounding errors.

**Rationale**:
- Cryptocurrency prices can have 8+ decimal places
- Large position values require high precision
- Cumulative errors in VWAP calculations can exceed 1bp with float64

**Fallback Strategy**: Int64 representation in smallest units (pips) if decimal128 proves problematic.

### 3. Fidelity Validation Metrics

**Comprehensive Metrics Catalog Developed**:

1. **Order Flow Dynamics**
   - Trade size distributions
   - Inter-event time distributions
   - Trade clustering patterns

2. **Market State Properties**
   - Bid-ask spread distributions
   - Top-of-book depth distributions
   - Order book imbalance metrics

3. **Price Return Characteristics**
   - Volatility clustering (GARCH effects)
   - Heavy tails (kurtosis > 3)
   - Microstructure noise patterns

**Validation Method**: Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with p > 0.05 threshold

### 4. Performance Considerations

**Throughput Requirements**: 
- Binance generates ~8M events per hour at peak
- Target: â‰¥100k events/second processing capability
- Memory constraint: <24GB for Beelink S12 Pro deployment

**Architecture Implications**:
- Streaming architecture with bounded queues
- Partitioned processing by time windows
- Write-ahead logging for fault tolerance

### 5. Data Quality Challenges

**Identified Issues**:
- Potential gaps in delta feed sequences
- Clock synchronization between trade and book events
- Missing origin_time in some historical data

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Sequence gap detection and handling
- Fallback to snapshot interpolation
- Statistical imputation for missing timestamps

## Research-Driven Design Decisions

1. **Epic 0 Introduction**: Research revealed that all validation must use real data, not synthetic
2. **Chronological Replay Algorithm**: Based on consensus approach across all models
3. **Decimal128 Specification**: Critical for financial accuracy per research findings
4. **Comprehensive Validation Suite**: Implements full metrics catalog from research
5. **Streaming Architecture**: Addresses performance requirements identified

## Deep-Dive Research Areas

### Market Microstructure Preservation
- Order book dynamics must be preserved at sub-second resolution
- Trade-through events indicate liquidity consumption
- Spread dynamics contain alpha signals for RL agents

### Statistical Properties Critical for RL
- Heavy tails in return distributions
- Volatility clustering for regime detection  
- Order flow imbalance as predictive feature

### Technical Implementation Considerations
- Polars selected for decimal128 support and performance
- Parquet format for efficient columnar storage
- Async processing for I/O optimization

## Validation Methodology

The research established a rigorous validation framework:

1. **Golden Sample Capture**: 24-48 hour windows from live market
2. **Statistical Comparison**: Full distribution analysis
3. **Visual Validation**: Q-Q plots, histograms, time series
4. **Automated Reporting**: Standardized fidelity reports

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data Quality First**: No amount of clever engineering can overcome bad data
2. **Validation is Critical**: Must prove fidelity before RL training
3. **Performance Matters**: 100k events/sec is minimum viable
4. **Precision is Non-Negotiable**: Decimal128 or equivalent required
5. **Real Data Essential**: Synthetic data validation is meaningless

This research formed the foundation for our PRD requirements and architectural decisions.
