# Validation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive validation strategy for the RLX Data Pipeline, based on findings from the AI research documents and implementation experience. The strategy emphasizes a validation-first approach before attempting complex reconstruction.

## Core Validation Principle

**Golden Sample Validation**: The pipeline's fidelity must be validated by comparing reconstructed historical data against "golden samples" of raw, unmodified live market data captured directly from Binance WebSocket streams.

## Golden Sample Requirements

### Data Collection
* **Duration**: Minimum 24-48 hour capture windows across different market regimes
* **Market Regimes**:
  * High volume period (e.g., US market open 14:30-21:00 UTC)
  * Low volume period (e.g., Asian overnight 02:00-06:00 UTC)  
  * Special event period (e.g., Fed announcement, options expiry)
* **Format**: Raw WebSocket messages preserved exactly as received
* **Storage**: `{"capture_ns": <nanosecond_timestamp>, "stream": "<stream_name>", "data": {<original_raw_message>}}`

### Critical Implementation Detail
The golden sample capture must preserve the **exact raw message format** from Binance. No parsing, transformation, or field extraction should occur during capture. This is essential for:
1. Validating that our reconstruction matches the actual exchange format
2. Detecting any data transformation errors in the pipeline
3. Ensuring backward compatibility if exchange formats change

## Validation Metrics

Based on convergence from the three AI research documents, the following metrics are critical:

### 1. Distributional Tests
* **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: 
  * Trade size distributions
  * Inter-event time distributions
  * Bid-ask spread distributions
  * Target: p-value > 0.05 (no significant difference)
* **Anderson-Darling Test**: Order size distributions
* **Power Law Validation**: Trade sizes should follow power law with exponent 2.4±0.1

### 2. Microstructure Metrics
* **Sequence Gap Detection**: Count and analyze any gaps in order book update sequences
* **Best Bid/Ask Price RMSE**: Compare against golden sample tick-by-tick
* **Order Book Depth Correlation**: Correlation at each price level (top 20)
* **Spread Dynamics**: Mean reversion characteristics and volatility patterns

### 3. Execution Quality Metrics
* **Fill Rate Accuracy**: Within 5% of historical patterns
* **Slippage Estimation**: R² > 0.8 vs actual market impact
* **Market Impact Model**: Validate square-root law compliance

### 4. Event Stream Integrity
* **Event Type Composition**: Ratio of trades to order book updates
* **Timestamp Monotonicity**: Ensure chronological ordering
* **Latency Distribution**: Network delay patterns

## Validation Process

### Phase 1: Basic Validation
1. Verify all events from historical data appear in reconstruction
2. Check timestamp ordering and gaps
3. Validate event schema compliance

### Phase 2: Statistical Validation
1. Run distributional tests on key metrics
2. Compare microstructure patterns
3. Generate correlation matrices

### Phase 3: Behavioral Validation
1. Simulate order execution on both streams
2. Compare fill rates and slippage
3. Validate market impact models

## Validation Tools

### Fidelity Report Generator
Automated tool that produces comprehensive comparison report including:
* All statistical test results with p-values
* Visual distributions comparisons
* Anomaly detection results
* Overall PASS/FAIL recommendation

### Continuous Validation
* Run validation on every pipeline change
* Maintain validation test suite
* Track metrics over time

## Decision Criteria

### PASS Criteria
* All K-S tests show p-value > 0.05
* Order book correlation > 0.99 at best bid/ask
* No systematic biases detected
* Fill rate accuracy within 5%

### FAIL Criteria  
* Any K-S test with p-value < 0.01
* Systematic gaps in order book sequences
* Event ordering violations
* Missing or duplicated events

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Challenges
1. **Timestamp Ambiguity**: Events with identical timestamps require consistent ordering rules
2. **Network Jitter**: Live capture may have different latency patterns than historical
3. **Exchange Maintenance**: Special handling for maintenance windows

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Document and apply consistent same-timestamp ordering rules
2. Include latency distribution in validation metrics
3. Flag and handle maintenance periods explicitly

## Integration with Development

### Pre-Implementation
* Review validation requirements before implementing features
* Design with validation testability in mind
* Document assumptions that affect validation

### During Implementation
* Run validation tests frequently
* Track metric trends
* Address validation failures immediately

### Post-Implementation
* Generate comprehensive fidelity report
* Document any accepted deviations
* Plan for ongoing validation monitoring

## Success Metrics

The validation strategy is successful when:
1. Pipeline passes all statistical tests consistently
2. No systematic differences detected vs live data
3. RL agents trained on reconstructed data perform identically to live
4. Validation process is automated and repeatable
