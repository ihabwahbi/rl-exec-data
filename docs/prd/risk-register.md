# Risk Register

## Overview

This document tracks identified risks for the RLX Data Pipeline project, their current status, and mitigation strategies. Risks are continuously monitored and updated throughout the project lifecycle.

## Risk Categories

- **RESOLVED** ‚úÖ - Risk has been addressed and is no longer a concern
- **ACTIVE** üî¥ - Risk is currently active and requires ongoing management
- **MONITORING** üü° - Risk is under control but requires continued monitoring
- **DEFERRED** ‚è∏Ô∏è - Risk acknowledged but not addressing in current phase

## Current Risks

### Technical Risks

#### [RISK][R-GMN-06] Polars Decimal128 Instability üü°
- **Description**: Polars marks Decimal type as unstable with history of regressions
- **Impact**: High - Could affect precision in financial calculations
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Implement int64 scaled arithmetic as primary approach, Decimal128 as fallback only
- **Status**: MONITORING - Primary mitigation implemented in Epic 2

#### [RISK][R-VAL-01] K-S Test Inadequacy üî¥
- **Description**: Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests fundamentally inadequate for financial time series validation
- **Impact**: High - Could miss critical distributional differences
- **Probability**: High (confirmed by research)
- **Mitigation**: Replace with Anderson-Darling and advanced test suite (Epic 3)
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Being addressed in Epic 3 implementation

#### [RISK][R-VAL-02] Computational Overhead üü°
- **Description**: Advanced validation tests may impact pipeline throughput
- **Impact**: Medium - Could slow down processing
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Three-tier architecture with appropriate latency budgets
- **Status**: MONITORING - Architecture designed, implementation pending

#### [RISK][R-VAL-03] Sim-to-Real Gap üî¥
- **Description**: RL agents may still experience performance degradation in production
- **Impact**: High - Core value proposition at risk
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive RL-specific validation metrics and <5% gap requirement
- **Status**: ACTIVE - Epic 3 validation suite designed to address

### Resolved Risks

#### Synthetic Data Fallback ‚úÖ
- **Description**: Risk of relying on synthetic data for validation
- **Resolution**: Real data acquired from Crypto Lake and validated
- **Date Resolved**: Epic 0 completion

#### Performance Validation ‚úÖ
- **Description**: Uncertainty about meeting performance requirements
- **Resolution**: All metrics validated with real data, exceeding requirements by 130x
- **Date Resolved**: Epic 1 completion

#### Delta Feed Gaps ‚úÖ
- **Description**: Potential sequence gaps in delta feed data
- **Resolution**: 0% gaps confirmed across 11.15M messages in all market regimes
- **Date Resolved**: Epic 1 Story 1.2.5 completion

## Risk Management Process

### Risk Identification
- Continuous identification through development and testing
- Research findings integrated as new risks discovered
- Team retrospectives to identify emerging risks

### Risk Assessment
- **Impact**: Low / Medium / High / Critical
- **Probability**: Low / Medium / High / Certain
- **Risk Score**: Impact √ó Probability

### Risk Mitigation
- Each risk requires documented mitigation strategy
- Mitigation effectiveness tracked through project metrics
- Regular review of mitigation approaches

### Risk Monitoring
- Weekly risk review during team meetings
- Update risk status based on mitigation progress
- Escalate critical risks to stakeholders immediately

## Historical Risk Trends

### Epic 0-1 (Data Acquisition & Validation)
- Started with 3 critical risks
- All resolved through systematic validation
- Key learning: Validation-first approach effective

### Epic 2 (Reconstruction Pipeline)
- 1 technical risk identified (Polars Decimal128)
- Mitigated through architecture design
- No new risks emerged during implementation

### Epic 3 (Fidelity Validation)
- 3 new risks identified from research
- Comprehensive mitigation plan developed
- Implementation will validate mitigation effectiveness

## Next Review

- **Date**: Start of Epic 3 Story 3.1
- **Focus**: Validation architecture performance impact
- **Key Decisions**: GPU infrastructure requirements
