# Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-24  
**Current Phase**: Epic 2 Complete - Ready for Epic 3

## Executive Summary

The RLX Data Pipeline project has achieved significant milestones with Epic 0 and Epic 1 fully complete, and now **Epic 2 is also 100% complete**. The validation-first approach proved highly successful, with 11.15M golden sample messages captured and a comprehensive validation framework implemented. The reconstruction pipeline has been successfully built with all 6 stories completed, achieving 336-345K messages/second throughput and meeting all acceptance criteria. The project is now ready to begin Epic 3 (Automated Fidelity Validation & Reporting) with a solid foundation of working components.

### Epic 3: Fidelity Reporting 🟢 **READY TO START**

All prerequisites met with Epic 2 completion. Ready to implement automated fidelity validation and reporting based on the reconstruction pipeline.

## Lessons Learned from Story 1.2

### What Went Wrong
- **Specification Clarity**: "Golden sample" purpose wasn't clear - dev transformed data instead of preserving raw
- **Missing Examples**: No input/output examples led to interpretation errors  
- **Assumption-Based Development**: Built based on what made sense rather than what was specified

### What We're Changing
1. **Validation-First Approach**: Build validation infrastructure before complex features
2. **Specification Standards**: All stories now require concrete examples
3. **Empirical Verification**: Test all AI research claims with real data
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, validate, then add complexity

### Impact
- **Short-term**: Added ~1 week for validation framework
- **Long-term**: Prevents months of potential rework
- **Quality**: Ensures >99.9% fidelity through continuous validation
