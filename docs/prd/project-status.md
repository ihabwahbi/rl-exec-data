# Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-21  
**Current Phase**: Epic 1 Complete - Ready for Epic 2

## Executive Summary

The RLX Data Pipeline project has made exceptional progress with Epic 0 fully complete and Epic 1 now **100% complete**. The validation-first approach has proven highly successful with 11.15M golden sample messages captured and a comprehensive validation framework implemented with 91% test coverage. Story 1.2.5 delta validation showed perfect results with **0% sequence gaps** across all market regimes, validating the most optimistic assumptions about data quality. The project is now ready to begin Epic 2 (Reconstruction Pipeline) with the **FullReconstruction strategy** based on perfect delta feed quality.

- Download speed: 34.3 MB/s
- Schema validation: 8 columns with proper BTC-USDT data

### Epic 1: Analysis & Validation ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

| Story | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1.1: Origin Time Analysis | ‚úÖ Complete | 0% invalid origin_time with 2.3M real records |
| 1.2: Live Capture | ‚úÖ Complete | Fixed and operational, capturing ~969 msgs/min |
| 1.2.1: Golden Sample Capture | ‚úÖ Complete | 11.15M messages captured across 3 market regimes |
| 1.3: Core Validation Framework | ‚úÖ Complete | 91% test coverage, production-ready |
| 1.2.5: Delta Validation | ‚úÖ Complete | **0% sequence gaps** in all 11.15M messages - **GO decision** |

**Major Achievements**: 
- Captured comprehensive golden samples: high volume (5.5M msgs), low volume (2.8M msgs), special event (2.8M msgs)
- Built streaming validation framework capable of handling multi-GB files
- Validated all technical assumptions with real data
- Performance exceeds requirements by 130x (13M events/sec vs 100k target)
- **Critical Discovery**: Delta feed quality is perfect - 0% sequence gaps in all 11.15M messages
- Processing performance validated at ~336K messages/second for golden sample analysis

**Validation Results Summary**:
- Delta feed quality: Perfect (0% gaps in 11.15M messages)
- Processing performance: ~336K messages/second
- Memory usage: <500MB for 1M messages (well under 28GB limit)
- Decimal128 strategy: Validated and viable
- GO decision for Epic 2 FullReconstruction strategy

### Epic 2: Reconstruction Pipeline üü¢ **READY TO START**

All prerequisites met:
- ‚úÖ Delta feed viability: **Perfect quality confirmed** - 0% gaps in 11.15M messages
- ‚úÖ Memory and performance baselines: **Exceeded by 14-130x**
- ‚úÖ Decimal strategy: decimal128 validated as primary approach
- ‚úÖ Golden samples: 11.15M messages ready for validation
- ‚úÖ ValidationFramework: 91% coverage, production-ready
- ‚úÖ **Strategy Decision**: FullReconstruction approach selected based on perfect delta quality

**Implementation Approach**: Based on the perfect delta feed quality discovered in Story 1.2.5, Epic 2 will implement the FullReconstruction strategy using book_delta_v2 data. This provides maximum fidelity by replaying every order book change event, ensuring the backtesting environment perfectly mirrors live trading conditions.

### Epic 3: Fidelity Reporting ‚è∏Ô∏è **BLOCKED**

Awaiting Epic 2 completion. Design complete but implementation depends on pipeline architecture.

## Lessons Learned from Story 1.2

### What Went Wrong
- **Specification Clarity**: "Golden sample" purpose wasn't clear - dev transformed data instead of preserving raw
- **Missing Examples**: No input/output examples led to interpretation errors  
- **Assumption-Based Development**: Built based on what made sense rather than what was specified

### What We're Changing
1. **Validation-First Approach**: Build validation infrastructure before complex features
2. **Specification Standards**: All stories now require concrete examples
3. **Empirical Verification**: Test all AI research claims with real data
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, validate, then add complexity

### Impact
- **Short-term**: Added ~1 week for validation framework
- **Long-term**: Prevents months of potential rework
- **Quality**: Ensures >99.9% fidelity through continuous validation
