# Next Steps

## Immediate Critical Action Required

**STOP**: Before any architecture or development work can begin, the following critical prerequisite must be completed:

### Phase 0: Data Acquisition (BLOCKING)
1. **Week 1**: Secure Crypto Lake account access and API credentials
2. **Week 1**: Download and verify 1-2 weeks of actual BTC-USDT historical data
3. **Week 1**: Validate data completeness and establish data refresh procedures
4. **Week 2**: Begin Epic 1 work using actual data

**NO OTHER WORK SHOULD PROCEED** until actual Crypto Lake data is acquired and validated.

## Architect Prompt

This PRD for the RLX Co-Pilot Data Pipeline has been updated to address the critical execution gap where validation work was performed on synthetic data while actual Crypto Lake data remained unacquired. The primary focus is now on:

1. **Data Acquisition First**: Securing actual historical data before any validation work
2. **Real Data Validation**: Ensuring all validation is performed on actual market data
3. **Preventing Execution Gaps**: Clear sequencing to prevent validation before data acquisition

Please review this updated document and create a corresponding **Architecture Document** that:
- Emphasizes data acquisition as the critical first milestone
- Details the specific design of Python scripts for processing actual Crypto Lake data
- Outlines module organization, data flow, and class structures for real data processing
- Includes implementation plans for the stateful replayer and automated "Fidelity Report" generator
- Adheres to the updated technical assumptions that prioritize real data over synthetic data
- Enables the sequential execution of the three epics with proper data prerequisites

**CRITICAL**: The architecture must include explicit gates to prevent development work from proceeding without actual data acquisition completion.
