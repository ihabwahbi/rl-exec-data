# Next Steps

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-22

## Epic 1 Complete - Ready for Epic 2 🚀

With Epic 1 **100% complete** and deep research insights integrated, the project is ready to begin Epic 2 with the FullReconstruction strategy enhanced by validated architecture patterns:

### 1. Epic 1 Retrospective ✅ COMPLETE
**All Validations Exceeded Expectations**
* **Delta Quality**: **0% sequence gaps** in 11.15M messages (perfect quality)
* **Performance**: 13M events/sec achieved (130x requirement)
* **Memory**: 1.67GB for 8M events (14x safety margin)
* **Strategy Decision**: **GO for FullReconstruction approach**

### 2. Begin Epic 2 Story 2.1 - Data Ingestion & Unification
**Priority: IMMEDIATE**
* **Implement Delta Feed Parser**: Parse book_delta_v2 data with perfect quality
* **Build Unified Event Stream**: Merge trades and deltas chronologically
* **Apply Validated Patterns**: Use streaming architecture from Epic 1
* **Continuous Validation**: Run ValidationFramework tests at each stage
* **Timeline**: Start this week

### 3. Design Order Book Reconstruction Engine
**Priority: HIGH**
* **Stateful Book Maintenance**: Track full order book state in memory
* **Sequence Validation**: Monitor for gaps (defensive, 0% expected)
* **Recovery Mechanisms**: Handle edge cases gracefully
* **Performance Optimization**: Target 100k+ events/sec sustained
* **Timeline**: Design this week, implement next

### 4. Leverage Epic 1 Assets
**Priority: CONTINUOUS**
* **Golden Samples**: 11.15M messages for continuous validation
* **ValidationFramework**: 91% test coverage, production-ready
* **Performance Baselines**: 13M events/sec capability proven
* **Perfect Data Quality**: 0% gaps enable highest fidelity

## Strategic Recommendations

### Validated Technical Approach
1. **FullReconstruction Strategy**: ✅ Enabled by perfect delta quality
2. **Streaming Architecture**: ✅ Proven to handle multi-GB files efficiently
3. **Decimal128 Precision**: ✅ Validated as primary approach
4. **Continuous Validation**: ✅ Framework ready with all validators

### Implementation Best Practices
1. **Raw Data Preservation**: Always preserve exact message formats
2. **Combined Stream Usage**: Use proper WebSocket endpoints (@depth@100ms)
3. **Validation-First Development**: Test assumptions before building
4. **Memory-Bounded Processing**: Stream large datasets, don't load entirely

### Risk Mitigation
All major risks have been resolved:
* ✅ **Delta Feed Quality**: 0% gaps confirmed
* ✅ **Performance**: 130x headroom above requirements
* ✅ **Memory Constraints**: 14x safety margin
* ✅ **Data Quality**: Origin time 100% reliable

## Epic 2 Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation
1. **Monday-Tuesday**: Epic 2 architecture design based on FullReconstruction
2. **Wednesday-Thursday**: Implement Story 2.1 delta parser
3. **Friday**: Validation checkpoint with golden samples

### Week 2: Core Engine
1. **Story 2.1b**: Order book reconstruction engine
2. **Story 2.2**: Stateful event replayer
3. **Continuous**: ValidationFramework integration

### Week 3: Production Readiness
1. **Story 2.3**: Data sink with Parquet output
2. **Performance optimization**: Ensure 100k+ events/sec
3. **End-to-end validation**: Full pipeline test

## Success Criteria

### Epic 2 Milestones
1. ⏸️ Delta parser handles 100M+ book_delta_v2 events
2. ⏸️ Order book reconstruction matches golden samples >99.9%
3. ⏸️ Pipeline sustains 100k+ events/sec throughput
4. ⏸️ Memory usage remains under 24GB for 8M events/hour
5. ⏸️ All K-S tests pass with p-value > 0.05

### Validation Checkpoints
* After each story: Run ValidationFramework tests
* Weekly: Generate fidelity reports vs golden samples
* Before Epic 3: Comprehensive end-to-end validation

## Key Architecture Decisions (Research-Validated)

### 1. FullReconstruction Strategy ✅ CONFIRMED
Based on 0% delta gaps, implement full event replay:
- Process every book_delta_v2 event in sequence
- Maintain complete order book state
- Maximum fidelity for RL agent training

### 2. Performance Architecture (From Research)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-01] Hybrid Delta-Event Sourcing (40-65% memory efficiency)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-01] Scaled int64 arithmetic for hot path
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-ALL-01] Micro-batching for vectorization
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-02] Memory-mapped I/O (13x improvement)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-02] Single-process per symbol (avoid GIL)

### 3. Unified Event Schema
```python
{
    "timestamp": int,  # Nanosecond precision
    "event_type": str,  # "trade" | "book_update"
    "symbol": str,     # "BTC-USDT"
    "data": dict,      # Event-specific payload
    "sequence": int    # For ordering validation
}
```

### 4. Data Structure Decisions (From Research)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-04] Hybrid: arrays for top-of-book, hash for deep
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-OAI-03] Copy-on-write checkpointing
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-04] Manual GC control in hot paths

### 5. Quality Assurance (Enhanced from Research)
- ValidationFramework at every stage
- Golden samples as ground truth
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-03] Multi-level spread analysis (L1-L20)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-03] Power law tail validation (α ∈ [2,5])
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-OAI-02] GARCH(1,1) volatility modeling
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-05] Order Flow Imbalance metrics
- Automated fidelity reporting
- Continuous statistical validation

## Risk Mitigation Updates

### New Risk Identified
* **[RISK][R-GMN-06] Polars Decimal128 Instability**: 
  - **Issue**: Polars marks Decimal type as unstable
  - **Mitigation**: Implement int64 scaled arithmetic as primary, Decimal128 as fallback
  - **Validation**: Benchmark both approaches in Story 2.1b

**PROJECT STATUS**: Epic 1 is **100% complete** with exceptional results. Deep research has been integrated with 20 new assumptions properly tagged and tracked. Epic 2 is ready to begin with the FullReconstruction strategy enhanced by industry best practices. All technical risks have been identified with mitigations in place.
