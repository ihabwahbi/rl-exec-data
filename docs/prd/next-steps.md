## Success Criteria

### Epic 3 Milestones
1. ‚è∏Ô∏è FidelityReporter processes 100K events/sec with <5% overhead
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è All core metrics match golden samples within 5% tolerance
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Statistical tests pass with p-value > 0.05
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Research validation quantifies all claimed benefits
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Automated reports generated in <30 seconds
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è RL-specific features integrated and tested

### Validation Checkpoints
* After each story: Run ValidationFramework tests
* Weekly: Generate fidelity reports vs golden samples
* Before Epic 3: Comprehensive end-to-end validation

## Key Architecture Decisions (Research-Validated)

### 1. FullReconstruction Strategy ‚úÖ CONFIRMED
Based on 0% delta gaps, implement full event replay:
- Process every book_delta_v2 event in sequence
- Maintain complete order book state
- Maximum fidelity for RL agent training

### 2. Performance Architecture (From Research)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-01] Hybrid Delta-Event Sourcing (40-65% memory efficiency)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-01] Scaled int64 arithmetic for hot path
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-ALL-01] Micro-batching for vectorization
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-02] Memory-mapped I/O (13x improvement)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-02] Single-process per symbol (avoid GIL)

### 3. Unified Event Schema
```python
{
    "timestamp": int,  # Nanosecond precision
    "event_type": str,  # "trade" | "book_update"
    "symbol": str,     # "BTC-USDT"
    "data": dict,      # Event-specific payload
    "sequence": int    # For ordering validation
}
```

### 4. Data Structure Decisions (From Research)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-04] Hybrid: arrays for top-of-book, hash for deep
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-OAI-03] Copy-on-write checkpointing
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-04] Manual GC control in hot paths

### 5. Quality Assurance (Enhanced from Research)
- ValidationFramework at every stage
- Golden samples as ground truth
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-03] Multi-level spread analysis (L1-L20)
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-GMN-03] Power law tail validation (Œ± ‚àà [2,5])
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-OAI-02] GARCH(1,1) volatility modeling
- > [ASSUMPTION][R-CLD-05] Order Flow Imbalance metrics
- Automated fidelity reporting
- Continuous statistical validation

## Research Assumptions Status Update

### VERIFIED ‚úÖ
* **[R-GMN-01]** Scaled Integer Arithmetic - Implemented and performance validated
* **[R-OAI-01]** Pending Queue Pattern - Implemented in streaming architecture
* **[R-ALL-01]** Micro-batching - Implemented with 100-1000 event batches

* **[R-CLD-03]** Multi-Level Spread Analysis - Not implemented
* **[R-GMN-03]** Power Law Tail Validation - Not implemented
* **[R-OAI-02]** GARCH Volatility Clustering - Not implemented

## Risk Mitigation Updates

### Epic 3 Risks
* **FidelityReporter Missing**: High impact - Story 3.0 added as blocker
* **Metric Complexity**: Medium impact - Split Story 3.1 into 3.1a/b
* **Research Validation**: Medium impact - Story 3.5 added
* **Timeline Extension**: High impact - Epic 3 now 20-25 days vs 10-15

### Technical Risks Resolved ‚úÖ
* **[RISK][R-GMN-06] Polars Decimal128**: Mitigated with int64 approach

**PROJECT STATUS**: Epic 2 is **100% complete** with exceptional engineering quality. However, critical gaps identified:
- FidelityReporter component: 0% implemented (only validation framework exists)
- Metric catalogue: 40% implemented (only basic validators)
- Visual reporting: 0% implemented
- Research validation: 0% implemented

Epic 3 scope has increased ~2x with 4 new stories added (3.0, 3.1a, 3.1b, 3.5). Re-estimation recommended: 20-25 days vs original 10-15 days.
