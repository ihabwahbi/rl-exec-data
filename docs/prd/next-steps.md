# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions Required

Based on the comprehensive review of Story 1.2 implementation and research findings, the following actions are recommended:

### 1. Fix Story 1.2 Implementation Issues
**Priority: CRITICAL**
* **Fix WebSocket URL**: Add `@100ms` suffix to depth stream
* **Fix Output Format**: Preserve raw messages as specified
* **Fix CLI Location**: Move script to correct location
* **Timeline**: Complete before any further development

### 2. Re-execute Story 1.1 with Real Data
**Priority: HIGH**
* **Validate Origin Time**: Confirm findings with actual Crypto Lake data
* **Update Documentation**: Document actual data characteristics
* **Timeline**: Immediately after Story 1.2 fixes

### 3. Implement Validation-First Approach
**Priority: HIGH**
* **Create Validation Framework**: Build comprehensive validation tools before reconstruction
* **Capture Golden Samples**: Multiple 24-48 hour windows across market regimes
* **Automate Fidelity Reports**: Implement statistical comparison tools
* **Timeline**: Epic 1 completion

### 4. Enhance Communication Process
**Priority: MEDIUM**
* **Research Integration**: Create summary documents for key research findings
* **Specification Clarity**: Add examples and clarifications to stories
* **Review Checkpoints**: Add architecture review before implementation
* **Timeline**: Ongoing

## Strategic Recommendations

### Technical Strategy
1. **Validation Before Complexity**: Build robust validation framework before attempting complex reconstruction
2. **Raw Data Preservation**: Always preserve original formats for validation purposes
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Implement comprehensive statistical tests from research findings
4. **Incremental Validation**: Test each component against golden samples

### Process Improvements
1. **Research Synthesis**: Create unified findings document from multiple research sources
2. **Architecture Reviews**: Mandatory review before implementation starts
3. **Clear Examples**: Include concrete examples in all specifications
4. **Definition Clarity**: Define technical terms explicitly (e.g., "golden sample")

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Early Validation**: Catch specification mismatches early through examples
2. **Continuous Testing**: Run validation suite on every change
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of decisions and rationale
4. **Flexibility**: Design for adaptation as we learn from real data

## Epic 1 Revised Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Fix Story 1.2 implementation issues
2. Re-run Story 1.1 with real Crypto Lake data
3. Capture first golden sample (24 hours)

### Phase 2: Validation Framework (Week 2)
1. Implement statistical validation tools
2. Capture additional golden samples (different regimes)
3. Build automated fidelity report generator

### Phase 3: Initial Validation (Week 3)
1. Run comprehensive validation on historical data
2. Document findings and gaps
3. Make go/no-go decision for Epic 2

## Success Criteria

The project will be on track when:
1. ✅ Story 1.2 captures raw, unmodified data correctly
2. ✅ Validation framework operational with statistical tests
3. ✅ Golden samples captured across market regimes
4. ✅ Fidelity reports show clear validation results
5. ✅ Team aligned on specifications through examples

## Architect Prompt

This PRD has been updated following a comprehensive review that identified critical issues in Story 1.2 implementation and highlighted the importance of validation-first approach based on AI research findings. The key updates include:

1. **Validation Strategy Document**: New comprehensive validation approach
2. **Technical Assumptions**: Updated with WebSocket stream requirements
3. **Requirements**: Clarified golden sample format and validation metrics
4. **Next Steps**: Revised to address immediate issues and strategic approach

Please review these updates and ensure the architecture supports:
- Raw data preservation for validation
- Comprehensive statistical validation framework
- Clear separation between capture, validation, and reconstruction phases
- Flexibility to adapt based on validation findings

**CRITICAL**: The architecture must support capturing and preserving exact raw message formats from Binance WebSocket streams without any transformation during the capture phase.
