# Next Steps

**Status**: PRD Finalized and Ready for Development Execution  
**Date**: July 30, 2025

## Formal PRD Handoff

The Product Requirements Document for the RLX Co-Pilot Data Pipeline project has been comprehensively reviewed, updated, and validated. The project is now ready to proceed with Epic 3 implementation.

## Primary References

1. **ðŸ“Œ Master Document**: [epics.md](./epics.md) - The definitive source of truth for project scope and sequencing
2. **Implementation Guide**: [epic-3-implementation-plan.md](./epic-3-implementation-plan.md) - Detailed plan for Epic 3 execution
3. **Current Status**: [project-status.md](./project-status.md) - Real-time project progress tracking

## Epic 3 Focus

**Primary Goal**: Achieve high-fidelity validation through comprehensive statistical testing and automated reporting.

**Key Deliverable**: FidelityReporter component that proves our reconstructed data is statistically indistinguishable from live market conditions.

## Development Team Action Items

1. Review the updated Epic 3 stories in epics.md
2. Begin with Story 3.0 (FidelityReporter Foundation) as the blocking task
3. Reference validation-strategy.md for advanced statistical test requirements
4. Maintain <5% performance overhead target throughout implementation

## Success Criteria

The project will be successful when the automated fidelity validation proves <5% sim-to-real gap, enabling reliable RL agent training on reconstructed historical data.
