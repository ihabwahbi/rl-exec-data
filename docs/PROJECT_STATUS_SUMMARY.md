# RLX Co-Pilot Data Pipeline - Project Status Summary

## Executive Summary
As of July 20, 2025, the RLX Co-Pilot Data Pipeline project has successfully completed Epic 0 (Data Acquisition) and made significant progress on Epic 1 (Foundational Analysis). Critical issues in Story 1.2 have been identified and fixed, establishing a solid foundation for the validation-first approach going forward.

## Current Project State

### Completed Work
1. **Epic 0: Data Acquisition** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Successfully acquired 2.3M+ records from Crypto Lake
   - Built production-ready pipeline with 49% test coverage
   - Achieved 34.3 MB/s download performance
   - Established robust error handling and staging patterns

2. **Story 1.1: Origin Time Analysis** ✅ COMPLETE
   - Re-executed with real data (was initially done with synthetic)
   - Found 0.00% invalid origin_time values
   - Confirmed reliability of Crypto Lake timestamps

3. **Story 1.2: Live Capture Implementation** ✅ FIXED
   - Critical issues discovered and resolved:
     - WebSocket URL now includes required @100ms suffix
     - Raw data preservation implemented (no transformation)
     - Single chronological file output
     - Async handling fixed to prevent 0-record captures
   - Capture now working: ~969 messages/minute confirmed

4. **Story 1.2.5: Technical Validation Spike** ✅ COMPLETE
   - All technical risks validated as acceptable
   - Performance exceeds requirements by 130x
   - Memory usage well within bounds
   - GO recommendation for Epic 2

### In Progress
- **Epic 1: Foundational Analysis** (40% complete)
  - Story 1.2.1: Golden Sample Capture (Ready to start)
  - Story 1.3: Core Validation Framework (Pending)

## Key Learnings & Pivots

### 1. Data-First Approach Success
The decision to block all work until real data access proved invaluable, preventing months of wasted effort on synthetic data validation.

### 2. Specification Clarity Critical
Story 1.2 issues arose from:
- Lack of concrete input/output examples
- Ambiguous terminology ("golden sample")
- Missing implementation details

### 3. Validation-First Architecture
Post-Story 1.2 fixes, we've adopted a validation-first approach:
- Every assumption must be empirically validated
- No complex implementation without proven validation
- Golden samples serve as ground truth

### 4. Performance Exceeds Expectations
Story 1.2.5 validation showed:
- 13M events/sec throughput (target: 100k)
- <500MB memory for 1M messages
- Decimal128 viable without performance impact

## Updated Architecture Direction

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Capture Golden Samples** (Story 1.2.1)
   - Start immediately now that capture is fixed
   - Three 24-hour sessions for different market regimes
   - Comprehensive validation scripts included

2. **Build Validation Framework** (Story 1.3)
   - Leverage patterns from successful Story 1.2.5 spike
   - Streaming architecture for large files
   - Comprehensive statistical validators

### Validation-First Principles
- No reconstruction without validated golden samples
- Every pipeline stage must pass statistical tests
- Continuous validation against ground truth
- Empirical evidence drives all decisions

## Story Updates Summary

### Story 1.2.1: Capture Production Golden Samples
**Major Enhancements:**
- Added comprehensive pre-capture validation script
- Included real-time monitoring scripts
- Enhanced post-capture validation with detailed metrics
- Added troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Included SHA-256 checksum generation
- Clear success criteria with quantitative thresholds

**Key Additions:**
- Executable validation scripts (not just snippets)
- Memory and disk space monitoring
- Network stability checks
- Gap detection with <0.01% threshold
- Metadata generation with full statistics

### Story 1.3: Implement Core Validation Framework
**Major Enhancements:**
- Added concrete implementation patterns from Story 1.2.5
- Included streaming architecture for >1GB files
- Enhanced with proven validator base classes
- Added performance monitoring and benchmarks
- Included checkpoint/resume capability
- Comprehensive test strategy with coverage requirements

**Key Additions:**
- Power law validation for trade sizes
- Sequence gap detection
- Async pipeline execution
- Memory usage monitoring
- OpenTelemetry export support
- Real integration test examples

## Recommended Sprint Plan

### Week 1 (Current)
1. **Monday**: Start high-volume golden sample capture (24h)
2. **Tuesday**: Monitor capture, start low-volume capture setup
3. **Wednesday**: Start low-volume capture (24h)
4. **Thursday**: Analyze initial captures, prepare special event capture
5. **Friday**: Start special event capture (options expiry)

### Week 2
1. **Monday-Tuesday**: Implement core validation framework (Story 1.3)
2. **Wednesday-Thursday**: Test framework with captured golden samples
3. **Friday**: Validate all Epic 1 assumptions, prepare Epic 2 approach

### Week 3
1. Begin Epic 2 implementation based on validation results
2. Use golden samples for continuous validation
3. Implement reconstruction with proven approach

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Start Captures Immediately
With Story 1.2 fixes confirmed, begin golden sample capture without delay. These samples are critical for all subsequent work.

### 2. Maintain Validation Discipline
Every implementation must be validated against golden samples before proceeding. No assumptions without empirical evidence.

### 3. Clear Communication
All specifications must include:
- Concrete input/output examples
- Validation criteria
- Success metrics
- Troubleshooting guides

### 4. Performance Monitoring
Continue tracking:
- Memory usage under 28GB limit
- Processing throughput
- Statistical validation metrics
- Gap ratios and data quality

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Network Instability**: Mitigated with automatic reconnection and monitoring
2. **Disk Space**: 50GB buffer required, monitoring scripts provided
3. **Memory Overflow**: Streaming architecture prevents issues
4. **Validation Failures**: Checkpoint/resume allows iterative fixes

### Contingency Plans
- Multiple capture instances for redundancy
- Cloud instance backup for captures
- Incremental validation with checkpoints
- Clear escalation paths defined

## Conclusion

The project is well-positioned for success with:
- Real data acquisition complete
- Critical capture issues resolved
- Clear validation-first path forward
- Comprehensive story updates for developer clarity

The immediate priority is executing golden sample captures while the development team implements the validation framework. With these foundations in place, Epic 2 reconstruction can proceed with confidence based on empirical validation rather than assumptions.

## Next Actions
1. Dev team: Start golden sample captures immediately
2. Dev team: Implement validation framework in parallel
3. SM: Monitor capture progress and coordinate validation
4. All: Use empirical results to guide Epic 2 approach
