# Dev Agent Debug Log

## Story 2.3: Implement Data Sink

### Task 1: Create data sink module structure
- Created `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/data_sink.py` with:
  - DataSinkConfig dataclass for configuration
  - DataSink class with async architecture
  - Queue-based input interface via `start()` method
  - Decimal128(38,18) schema definition using PyArrow
  - Event-to-dict conversion with proper null handling
  - Hour-based partitioning logic
  - Placeholder for atomic write operations (to be completed in Task 4)

### Task 2: Implement Parquet writing with decimal128 precision
- Implemented `_write_partition()` method to write events to Parquet files
- Created `_create_arrow_table()` method to convert events to PyArrow table
- Properly handles decimal128(38,18) for all price/quantity fields
- Maintains null values for event-type-specific fields
- Uses PyArrow's write_table with compression and proper settings
- Tests verify decimal precision is preserved in output files

### Task 3: Implement partitioning strategy
- Enhanced `_write_partition()` with file size monitoring
- Added `_estimate_table_size()` method for size prediction
- Implements automatic file splitting when partition exceeds max_file_size_mb
- Creates directory structure: {output_dir}/BTCUSDT/{year}/{month}/{day}/{hour}/
- Generates filenames with nanosecond timestamps and optional sequence numbers
- Tests verify file splitting works correctly with size limits

### Task 4: Implement atomic write operations
- Modified `_write_partition()` to write to .tmp files first
- Implements atomic rename after successful write
- Added `_cleanup_temp_files()` method called on initialization
- Handles write failures with proper error recovery and temp file cleanup
- Tests verify atomic operations and failure recovery

### Task 5: Implement manifest tracking
- Created `src/rlx_datapipe/reconstruction/manifest.py` module
- Implemented ManifestTracker class with atomic append-only updates
- Uses file locking for concurrent access safety
- Stores comprehensive metadata for each partition
- Provides time-range queries and statistics
- Integrated manifest tracking into DataSink._write_partition()
- Tests verify manifest operations and integration

### Task 6: Optimize for streaming performance
- Enhanced `_write_batch()` to pre-sort events by timestamp
- Implemented concurrent writes for multiple partitions using asyncio
- Added memory usage estimation with `_estimate_event_memory()`
- Enforces memory limit (500MB) for batch accumulation
- Batching already implemented in `start()` method (5000 events)
- Tests verify sorting, memory estimation, and concurrent writes
