  Research Prompt: Production-Scale Performance & Reliability for High-Throughput Statistical Validation and RL Training Integration

  Research Objective

  To develop a comprehensive understanding of distributed computing architectures, performance optimization strategies, and reliability patterns necessary to build a
  production-scale fidelity validation system that can process 336K+ messages/second repeatedly, integrate seamlessly with RL training pipelines, and operate continuously without
  becoming a bottleneck in the model development lifecycle.

  Background Context

  - Our reconstruction pipeline achieves 336-345K messages/second, generating massive datasets (100GB+ per day)
  - Epic 3 requires running complex statistical validations repeatedly on this data
  - The validation system must not become a bottleneck for RL agent training iterations
  - We need to validate against 11.15M golden samples while processing new data continuously
  - Current ValidationFramework achieves 49K messages/second but needs to scale 10x for production
  - RL teams need rapid iteration cycles - any validation delays directly impact productivity
  - The system must maintain reliability while processing petabyte-scale data over months
