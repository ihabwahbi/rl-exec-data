  Research Prompt: Statistical Fidelity Validation at Scale for High-Frequency Trading Data Reconstruction

  Research Objective

  To develop a comprehensive understanding of advanced statistical validation techniques for proving that reconstructed high-frequency trading data is statistically
  indistinguishable from live market data, with specific focus on methods that scale to 336K+ messages/second and are suitable for training reinforcement learning agents for
  quantitative trading.

  Background Context

  - We've successfully built a data reconstruction pipeline (Epic 2) achieving 336-345K messages/second throughput
  - We have 11.15M golden sample messages from live market capture across 3 market regimes
  - Current validation uses basic Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and power law validation
  - The reconstructed data will be used to train RL agents for execution optimization
  - Any statistical differences between reconstructed and live data could cause catastrophic sim-to-real performance gaps
  - We need validation that goes beyond simple distributional tests to capture complex market microstructure dynamics
