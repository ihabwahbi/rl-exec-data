  Research Prompt: High-Frequency Trading Event Dynamics - Understanding Microsecond-Scale Market Behavior for Accurate Reconstruction

  Research Objective

  To develop deep expertise in high-frequency trading event dynamics and microsecond-scale market behaviors, enabling our reconstruction pipeline to accurately capture and preserve
  the complex temporal patterns, cross-event dependencies, and microstructure phenomena that are critical for training effective reinforcement learning agents in modern electronic
  markets.

  Background Context

  - Our reconstruction pipeline processes 336-345K messages/second, placing us firmly in HFT-scale data territory
  - We've identified 0% sequence gaps in our delta feed, but sequence integrity alone doesn't guarantee preservation of HFT dynamics
  - The golden samples show event clustering at sub-millisecond scales during high-volume periods
  - RL agents trained on our data will need to compete in markets dominated by HFT participants
  - Microsecond-scale dynamics like quote stuffing, momentum ignition, and fleeting liquidity can significantly impact execution quality
  - Our current understanding of these phenomena is limited, creating risk of training RL agents on oversimplified market dynamics
